<p class="caption2"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></p>

<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T IS especially fitting to issue this book&mdash;in fact, any
book on the life and work of Abraham Lincoln&mdash;at
this time, just preceding the centennial of his birth.
Insignificant as the little volume may seem, it will have
earned its right to publication if it bring, in whatever
small measure, before the growing mind of the country
a better realization of the grand life of the noble Lincoln&mdash;the
loved and martyred President&mdash;inspired by God
and divinely prepared for a great purpose: to guard and
preserve a free and united country.</p>

<p>One hundred years seem but a day! One thousand
years hence a deeper feeling will be felt for everything
concerning Lincoln, as with each passing year he grows
in the affections of the people. His body is dead, but his
memory will live in the hearts of the people as long as
our country shall cherish freedom and liberty. He was a
born king of men, with an intense and yearning love for
his fellows and their welfare, which knew neither rank,
race, nor creed, but gathered within its boundless charity
all mankind.</p>

<p>What a shining xample this simple but sublime life
offers to our growing youth! Born of humble parents,
surrounded by poverty and hardships such as we seldom
encounter today, his rise to the highest position in the
gift of the American people&mdash;which position he not only
ably filled but highly honored&mdash;is a grand illustration of
persistence and ambition; ambition, though, tempered
with foresight and wisdom. His was an exemplary character:
a character which for quaint simplicity, earnestness,
kindness, truthfulness and purity has never been surpassed
among the historic personages of the world. His
figure, too, more than any other in the history of our
country, illustrates that America is the land of opportunity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
In short, to us he is the representative and typical
American.</p>

<p>He missed the polish that higher education affords,
polish though he needed not. What would not this country,
with all its bright and polished men, give today for
another man of rugged education, rugged honesty and
rugged foresight and wisdom as was Abraham Lincoln?
It is hard to measure the usefulness of the life of such a
man, yet more hard to do his memory justice. Great
qualities of heart and head did he possess, of patience,
patriotism, and piety, too. He occupies a unique place
in our nation's history. Though most of us never saw
him, yet we feel daily the influence of his just and kindly
life bound up in the two titles given him by his neighbors
and those who knew him well: "Honest Old Abe" and
"Father Abraham."</p>

<p>The matter in this book, the only one of its kind published,
is intended not only for the entertainment of children
but for their instruction also. The contents for the
most part is new, much of it having been written especially
for the book by Marie Irish, Clara J. Denton,
and Laura R. Smith, and some gathered from various
sources and adapted by the compiler. It is arranged as
nearly as possible under the various headings in degree
of difficulty, primary material being placed first.</p>

<p>Grateful acknowledgments are rendered to all magazines,
periodicals and books from whose pages selections
have been gleaned and without which the book could not
have been complete. Proper credit has been given
wherever such matter appears. A few selections have
been used of which the names of author or publisher are
unknown. For these it has been impossible to give proper
credit. In cases where unintentional infringements have
been made, sincere apologies are tendered.</p>

A hero is always a brave man, you know.<br />

Here on this first page is Washington grand,<br />
He fought for our liberty, our free, honored land.<br />
<br />
And next we see our loved Lincoln so brave,<br />
You know he gave freedom to each poor old slave.<br />
<br />
And here's General Grant! Think what battles he won!<br />
He fought that all States be united as one.<br />
<br />
You see all these heroes are both good and great,<br />
And each gave his life for his country and state.<br />

The last is a hero,&mdash;now think who 'twill be!<br />
He, too, will be great; now look and see,&mdash;Me.<br />

Why was he famed above other men,<br />
His name upon every tongue and pen,&mdash;<br />

A mighty brain, a will to endure,<br />

A heart that was brave, and strong, and sure,<br />
A soul that was noble, and great, and pure,<br />
A faith in God that was held secure,&mdash;<br />

<p class="poetry">
<span class="dropcap">I</span>'VE heard the beautiful stories<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Lincoln so great and so good.</span><br />
He helped all people in trouble,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their grief so well understood;</span><br />
To many sad tales he listened,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of heart-broken mothers and wives;</span><br />
And pausing 'mid all his worries,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once more he brought hope to their lives.</span><br />
<br />
Dearer than all other stories,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is this little one of the day</span><br />
When he, with his friends, was riding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On horseback along the roadway;</span><br />
There, in the dust, by a tree, he found<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One little bird, then another,</span><br />
From their nest the wind had blown them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he was hunting for their mother.</span><br />
<br />
When at last he found the nest, and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In it the birdies laid,</span><br />
'Mid the party's merry laughter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His heart was glad, his manner grave:</span><br />
"Seems to me," he said, "I couldn't<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tonight in bed with ease have slept</span><br />
Had I left those creatures suffer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not restored them to their nest."</span><br />
<br />
Wonderful heart; ever tender&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tender, yet <i>just</i>, with the rest.</span><br />
I think among all the stories,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This shows his true nature the best.</span><br />

And do my loyal service for honor and for right<br />
And victory and glory! But children now, you know,<br />
Have never any chance at all to war against a foe.<br />
<br />
And as I think upon it, the best that we can do<br />
To show our love and honor for a hero brave and true,<br />
Is to resolve together always to be brave,<br />
To live our very noblest in the land he died to save.<br />

Before those cries of joy and love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Earth's brightest gauds grew dim.</span><br />

And, I think, his heart that morning<br />

Days of plenty and years of peace;<br />
March of a strong land's swift increase;<br />
Equal justice, right, and law,<br />
Stately honor and reverend awe;<br />
<br />
Sign of a nation, great and strong<br />
To ward her people from foreign wrong;<br />
Pride and glory and honor,&mdash;all<br />
Live in the colors to stand or fall.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Hats off!</span><br />
Along the street there comes<br />
A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums;<br />
And loyal hearts are beating high.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Hats off!</span><br />
The flag is passing by!<br />

Not toward men, but the infamous measures<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">False to the nation, the home and the state.</span><br />

Tell them; yes, tell them, his highest ambition<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was of all men in the nation to stand</span><br />
Close to the hearts of the people who loved him&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Loved him and chose him to rule in the land.</span><br />
<br />
Tell to the boys the sad story of Lincoln;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tell of his trials when traitors defied</span><br />
And spurned the old flag; how the nation's defenders<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At his call rallied and sprang to his side;</span><br />
<br />
Tell how he suffered when news of the battle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Told of disaster, of wounded and dead;</span><br />
Tell how his great noble heart was oft gladdened<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">When as proud victors our armies were led.</span><br />

So linked with mighty deeds of old,<br />
So steeped in blood where heroes fell,<br />

So calm, so still, so firm, so true,<br />

Upon the top of Bunker Hill,<br />
Who crushed the Britons' cruel will,<br />
'Mid shock and roar and crash and scream,<br />
Who crossed the Delaware's frozen stream,<br />
Who starved, who fought, who bled, who died,<br />
That you might float in glorious pride,<br />

What of the women brave and true, Old Flag,<br />
Who, while the cannon thundered wild,<br />
Sent forth a husband, lover, child,<br />
Who labored in the field by day,<br />
Who, all the night long, knelt to pray,<br />
And thought that God great mercy gave,<br />
If only freely you might wave,<br />

And gather in one joyful throng<br />
Beneath your folds in close embrace<br />
All burdened ones of every race,<br />

Right nobly do you lead the way, Old Flag.<br />
Your stars shine out for liberty,<br />
Your white stripes stand for purity,<br />

For honor's sake to fight and die.<br />
Lead on against the alien shore!<br />

Born with strong arms that unfought victories won,<br />

Of winning with his humor, and he went<br />
Straight to his mark, which was the human heart;<br />
Wise, too, for what he could not break he bent.<br />
Upon his back a more than Atlas' load<br />

Shot suddenly downwards, not a whit dismayed.<br />

Therefore we love him with a love apart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From any fawning love of pedigree&mdash;</span><br />
His was the royal soul and mind and heart&mdash;<br />

Forgive us then, O friends, if we are slow<br />

And round the breaking Union bound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wove it firmly. To his task</span><br />
He rose gigantic; nor could sound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of menace daunt him. Did he ask</span><br />
For homage when glad Victory<br />
Followed his flags from sea to sea?<br />
Nay, but he staunched the wounds of war;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
And you owe all you have and are&mdash;<br />
And I owe all I have and am<br />
To great, gaunt, patient Abraham.<br />
<br />
The pillars of our temple rocked<br />
Beneath the mighty wind that shocked<br />
Foundations that the fathers laid;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he upheld the roof and stood</span><br />
Fearless, while others were afraid;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His sturdy strength and faith were good,</span><br />
While coward knees together knocked,<br />
And traitor hands the door unlocked,<br />
To let the unbeliever in.<br />
He bore the burden of our sin,<br />
While the rebel voices rose to damn<br />
The great, gaunt, patient Abraham.<br />
<br />
And then he died a martyr's death&mdash;<br />
Forgiveness in his latest breath,<br />
And peace upon his dying lips.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He died for me; he died for you;</span><br />
Heaven help us if his memory slips<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of our hearts! His soul was true</span><br />
And clean and beautiful. What saith<br />
Dull history that reckoneth<br />
But coldly? That he was a man<br />
Who loved his fellows as few can;<br />
And that he hated every sham&mdash;<br />
Our great, gaunt, patient Abraham.<br />
<br />
Majestic, sweet, was Washington;<br />
And Jefferson was like the sun&mdash;<br />
He glorified the simplest thing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He touched; and Andrew Jackson seems</span><br />
The impress of a fiery king<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To leave upon us: these in dreams</span><br />
Are oft before us; but the one<br />
Whose vast work was so simply done&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span>
The Lincoln of our war-tried years&mdash;<br />
Has all our deepest love; in tears,<br />
We chant the In Memoriam<br />
Of great, gaunt, patient Abraham.<br />

<p class="poetry">
<span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the Norn-Mother saw the Whirlwind Hour<br />
Greatening and darkening as it hurried on,<br />
She left the Heaven of Heroes and came down<br />
To make a man to meet the mortal need.<br />
She took the tried clay of the common road&mdash;<br />
Clay warm yet with the genial heat of Earth,<br />
Dashed through it all a strain of prophecy;<br />
Tempered the heap with thrill of mortal tears;<br />
Then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff.<br />
It was a stuff to hold against the world,<br />
A man to match our mountains, and compel<br />
The stars to look our way and honor us.<br />
<br />
The color of the ground was in him, the red earth;<br />
The tang and odor of the primal things;<br />
The rectitude and patience of the rocks;<br />
The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span>
The courage of the bird that dares the sea;<br />
The justice of the rain that loves all leaves;<br />
The pity of the snow that hides all scars;<br />
The loving-kindness of the wayside well;<br />
The tolerance and equity of light<br />
That gives as freely to the shrinking weed<br />
As to the great oak flaring to the wind&mdash;<br />
To the grave's low hill as to the Matterhorn<br />
That shoulders out the sky.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">And so he came.</span><br />
From prairie cabin up to Capitol,<br />
One fair Ideal led our chieftain on.<br />
Forevermore he burned to do his deed<br />
With the fine stroke and gesture of a king.<br />
He built the rail-pile as he built the State,<br />
Pouring his splendid strength through every blow,<br />
The conscience of him testing every stroke,<br />
To make his deed the measure of a man.<br />
<br />
So came the Captain with the mighty heart;<br />
And when the step of Earthquake shook the house,<br />
Wrenching the rafters from their ancient hold,<br />
He held the ridgepole up, and spiked again<br />
The rafters of the Home. He held his place&mdash;<br />
Held the long purpose like a growing tree&mdash;<br />
Held on through blame and faltered not at praise.<br />
And when he fell in whirlwind, he went down<br />
As when a kingly cedar green with boughs<br />
Goes down with a great shout upon the hills,<br />
And leaves a lonesome place against the sky.<br />

<p class="poetry">
<span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU lay a wreath on murdered Lincoln's bier,<br />
You, who with mocking pencil wont to trace,<br />
Broad for the self-complacent British sneer,<br />
His length of shambling limb, his furrowed face,<br />
His gaunt, gnarled hands, his unkempt, bristling hair,<br />
His garb uncouth, his bearing ill at ease,<br />
His lack of all we prize as debonair,<br />
Of power or will to shine, of art to please.<br />
<br />
You, whose smart pen backed up the pencil's laugh,<br />
Judging each step as though the way were plain:<br />
Reckless, so it could point its paragraph<br />
Of chief's perplexity, or people's pain.<br />
Beside this corpse that bears for winding-sheet<br />
The Stars and Stripes he lived to rear anew,<br />
Between the mourner at his head and feet,<br />
Say, scurril-jester, is there room for you?<br />
Yes! He had lived to shame me from my sneer,<br />
To lame my pencil and confute my pen;<br />
To make me own this hind of princes peer,<br />
This rail-splitter, a true-born king of men.<br />
My shallow judgment I had learned to rue,<br />
Noting how to occasion's height he rose,<br />
How his quaint wit made home truth seem more true,<br />
How, iron-like, his temper grew by blows.<br />
<br />
How humble, yet how hopeful, he could be:<br />
How in good fortune and in ill the same:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
Nor bitter in success, nor boastful he,<br />
Thirsty for gold, nor feverish for fame.<br />
He went about his work&mdash;such work as few<br />
Ever had laid on head and heart and hand&mdash;<br />
As one who knows, where there's a task to do,<br />
Man's honest will must Heaven's good grace command;<br />
Who trusts the strength will with the burden grow,<br />
That God makes instruments to work His will,<br />
If but that will we can arrive to know,<br />
Nor tamper with the weights of good and ill.<br />
So he went forth to battle, on the side<br />
That he felt clear was Liberty's and Right's,<br />
As in his peasant boyhood he had plied<br />
His warfare with rude Nature's thwarting mights&mdash;<br />
The uncleared forest, the unbroken soil,<br />
The iron-bark, that turns the lumberer's axe,<br />
The rapid that o'erbears the boatman's toil,<br />
The prairie hiding the mazed wanderer's tracks,<br />
The ambushed Indian, and the prowling bear&mdash;<br />
Such were the deeds that helped his youth to train:<br />
Rough culture&mdash;but such trees large fruit may bear,<br />
If but their stocks be of right girth and grain.<br />
<br />
So he grew up a destined work to do,<br />
And lived to do it: four long-suffering years.<br />
Ill-fate, ill-feeling, ill-report lived through,<br />
And then he heard the hisses changed to cheers,<br />
The taunts to tribute, the abuse to praise,<br />
And took both with the same unwavering mood:<br />
<br />
Till, as he came on light, from darkling days<br />
And seemed to touch the goal from where he stood,<br />
A felon hand, between the goal and him,<br />
Reached from behind his back, a trigger prest,<br />
And those perplexed and patient eyes were dim,<br />
Those gaunt, long-laboring limbs were laid to rest!<br />
The words of mercy were upon his lips,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span>
Forgiveness in his Heart and on his pen,<br />
When this vile murderer brought swift eclipse<br />
To thoughts of peace on earth, good will to men.<br />
<br />
The Old World and the New, from sea to sea,<br />
Utter one voice of sympathy and shame.<br />
Sore heart, so stopped when it at last beat high!<br />
Sad life, cut short just as its triumph came!<br />
A deed accurst! Strokes have been struck before<br />
By the assassin's hand, whereof men doubt<br />
If more of horror or disgrace they bore;<br />
But thy foul crime, like Cain's, stands darkly out,<br />
Vile hand, that brandest murder on a strife,<br />
Whate'er its grounds, stoutly and nobly striven,<br />
And with the martyr's crown crownest a life<br />
With much to praise, little to be forgiven.<br />

<p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> The authorship of this poem seems to be surrounded by somewhat
of a doubt. Mark Lemon, editor of <span class="smcap">Punch</span> at the time when
this was written, is sometimes accredited with writing the tribute;
then again, Spielman's <span class="smcap">History of Punch</span> ascribes it to Shirley
Brooks, who also was editor of <span class="smcap">Punch</span> for a few years.
</p>
<p>
The poem first appeared anonymously in the London <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, May
6, 1865. Accompanying it was an engraving of Brittania mourning
at Lincoln's bier and placing a wreath thereon. Columbia was represented
as weeping at the head of the President, and at the foot of
the bier was a slave with broken shackles. Underneath was the inscription,
"Brittania sympathizes with Columbia."
</p>
<p>
It is now generally believed that the author of the famous tribute
was the journalist and dramatist, Tom Taylor, the author of the
comedy, <span class="smcap">Our American Cousin</span>, a performance of which President
Lincoln was witnessing at the time of his assassination.</p></div>

<p class="poetry">
<span class="dropcap">L</span>INCOLN arose! the masterful, great man,<br />
Girt with rude grandeur, quelling doubt and fear,&mdash;<br />
A more than king, yet in whose veins there ran<br />
The red blood of the people, warm, sincere,<br />
Blending of Puritan and Cavalier.<br />
A will whose force stern warriors came to ask,<br />
A heart that melted at a mother's tear&mdash;<br />
These brought he to his superhuman task:<br />
Over a tragic soul he wore a comic mask.<br />
<br />
He was the South's child more than of the North!<br />
His soul was not compact of rock and snow,<br />
But such as old Kentucky's soil gives forth,&mdash;<br />
The splendid race of giants that we know,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
Firm unto friend, and loyal unto foe,<br />
Such birthrights all environment forestall,<br />
Resistlessly their tides of impulse flow.<br />
This man who answered to his country's call<br />
Was full of human faults, and nobler for them all.<br />
<br />
He is a life, and not a legend, yet:<br />
For thousands live who shook him by the hand,<br />
Millions whose sympathies with his were set,<br />
Whose hopes and griefs alike with his were grand,<br />
Who deeply mourned his passing. They demand<br />
Our homage to the greatest man they saw,&mdash;<br />
They, his familiars; and throughout our land<br />
The years confirm them, over race and law:<br />
Even of rancor now the voice is hush'd in awe.<br />

<blockquote>

<p>Extract from an address delivered before the Chicago Lincoln
Association, February 12, 1891.</p>
</blockquote>


<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">G</span>OD'S providence has raised up a leader in every
time of a people's exceeding need.</p>

<p>Moses, reared in the family of Pharaoh,
initiated in the sublime mysteries of the priestcraft of
Egypt, partaking of the power and splendor of royal
family and favor, himself a ruler and almost a king, was
so moved by the degraded and helpless condition of his
enslaved brethren that for their sake he undertook what
to human understanding seemed the impossible problem
of deliverance....</p>

<p>A peasant girl, a shepherdess, dreaming on the hills of
France, feels her simple heart burn with the story of
her country's wrongs. Its army beaten, shattered and
dispersed; its fields laid waste; its homes pillaged and
burned; its people outraged and murdered; its prince
fleeing for life before a triumphant and remorseless foe.
Hope for France was dead. Heroes, there were none to
save. What could a woman do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span></p>

<p>Into the soul of this timid, unlettered mountain maid
there swept a flood of glorious resolve. Some power, unknown
to man, drew back the curtain from the glass of
fate and bade her look therein. As in a vision, she sees
a new French army, courageous, hopeful, victorious, invincible.
A girl, sword in hand, rides at its head; before
it the invaders flee. She sees France restored, her
fields in bloom, her cottages in peace, her people happy,
her prince crowned.</p>

<p>The rail-splitter of Illinois became President of the
United States in the darkest hour of the nation's peril.
Inexperienced and untrained in governmental affairs, he
formulated national politics, overruled statesmen, directed
armies, removed generals, and, when it became
necessary to save the Republic, set at naught the written
Constitution. He amazed the politicians and offended
the leaders of his party; but the people loved him by instinct,
and followed him blindly. The child leads the
blind man through dangerous places, not by reason of
controlling strength and intelligence, but by certainty of
vision. Abraham Lincoln led the nation along its
obscure pathway, for his vision was above the clouds,
and he stood in the clear sunshine of God's indicated will.</p>

<p>So stands the mountain while the murky shadows
thicken at its base, beset by the tempest, lashed by the
storm, darkness and desolation on every side; no gleam
of hope in the lightning's lurid lances, nor voice of safety
in the crashing thunder-bolts; but high above the top-most
mist, vexed by no wave of angry sound, kissed by
the sun of day, wooed by the stars at night, the eternal
summit lifts its snowy crest, crowned with the infinite
serenity of peace.</p>

<p>"And God said&mdash;let there be light, and there was
light." Light on the ocean, light on the land.</p>

<p>"And God said&mdash;let there be light, and there was
light." Light from the cross of calvary, light from the
souls of men.</p>

<p>"And God said&mdash;let there be light, and there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span>
light'." Light from the emancipation proclamation, light
on the honor of the nation, light on the Constitution of
the United States, light on the black faces of patient
bondmen, light on every standard of freedom throughout
the world.</p>

<p>From the hour in which the cause of the Union became
the cause of liberty, from the hour in which the
flag of the Republic became the flag of humanity, from
the hour in which the stars and stripes no longer floated
over a slave; yea, from the sacred hour of the nation's
new birth, that dear old banner never faded from the
sky, and the brave boys who bore it never wavered in
their onward march to victory....</p>

<p>After a quarter of a century of peace and prosperity,
all children of our common country kneel at the altar of
a reunited faith. The Blue and Gray lie in eternal slumber
side by side. Heroes all, they fell face to face,
brother against brother, to expiate a nation's sin. The
lonely firesides and the unknown graves, the memory of
the loved, the yearning for the lost, the desolated altars
and the broken hopes, are past recall. The wings of our
weak protests beat in vain against the iron doors of fate.
But through the mingled tears that fall alike upon the
honored dead of both, the North and South turn hopeful
eyes to that new future of prosperity and power, possible
only in the shelter of the dear old flag. To the
conquerors and the conquered, to the white man and the
black, to the master and the slave, Abraham Lincoln was
God's providence.</p>

And gave his spirit up in thund'rous song,<br />
Oh, mighty Master of the mighty lyre!<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: Dark calico gown very plainly made, wide gingham
apron, hair parted in the middle, combed straight back from
the face, and arranged in knot at back. Let this character be
taller than the other girls, if possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>: Blue overalls and blouse. This character should
be taller than the other boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span>: Short, plainly-made calico gown; hair arranged in two
long braids, fastened together by dark thread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Johnston</span>: Blue overalls and blouse, battered fur cap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matilda Johnston</span>: Gown like Sarah's although different in
color, hair also done up like Sarah's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">« 71 »</a></span></p>


<p>SCENE</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Very</span> plain interior. Pine table at center. Split-bottom rocker
near it. Two old-fashioned wooden chairs placed a few feet apart
at right-front, the same at left-front. At left-rear is a pine cupboard,
on the open shelves of which are some cheap earthen dishes.
This cupboard must be placed so that the characters can pass behind
it to reach the suggested fireplace. Several skins of animals
may be tacked about the walls; a pair of deer-antlers should also
be in evidence. An old-fashioned gun with powder-horn might be
hung in a conspicuous position. A wool spinning-wheel would add
to the old-time effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span> and <span class="smcap">Sarah</span> are discovered; the former,
seated in the rocker, is mending a pair of ragged overalls,
which, as she talks, she from time to time holds up and
spreads out as if looking for holes. <span class="smcap">Sarah</span>, at rear of
stage, is sweeping vigorously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: Dear me, Sarah! what a dust you do
kick up (<i>coughs</i>); you'll choke me to death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>sweeping more gently</i>): Excuse me, but you
see, the dirt is all here, and I suppose the only way to
get it out <i>is</i> to kick it up; but I'll try to be more careful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> (<i>behind scenes</i>): Abe, Abe, O, Abe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: How strange it is that I just can't
teach John not to stand and call out that way. I've tried
ever since he was a baby to make him go to anyone that
he wants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span>: I suppose he thinks it doesn't matter as long
as he's just calling Abe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: But it does matter, because it's a bad
habit, and a bad habit is mighty easy to get and mighty
hard to lose. I don't have a bit of trouble teaching all
those things to Abe. Dear me, he's such a good, obedient
boy; I don't believe he'll live to grow up (<i>sighs</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span>: O, yes he will, mother; he's too full of mischief
to die; besides, he's the strongest boy for his age
that there is anywhere around here. He picked Matilda
and me both up yesterday and carried us clear to the
woods. We kicked and screamed (<i>laughs</i>) and squirmed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span>
but oh my! we're just like a pair of dolls to him. He
set us down at the edge of the woods, then started on a
run. We started too, but he was in the barn and clear
at the top of the corn-stalks stacked in the mow before
we were half way to the house (<i>laughs</i>). Don't worry
about his dying, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> (<i>again</i>): Abe, Abe, O, Abe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: What shall I do with that boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span>: Don't do anything. Just let him keep right
on howling until he gets tired of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: But I'm tired of hearing him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span>: Shall I go and make him keep still? (<i>Laughs
and gesticulates.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>enters at right</i>): Where's Abe, mother? I've
been calling and calling him. (<i>Sits in chair at right-front.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span>: Yes, we thought we heard something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: Take off your hat, my son. I do wish
you didn't need telling that so often.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>removes hat</i>): But I want Abe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: To help me carry in the wood. There's a big
storm coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: Well, he isn't here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Isn't here? What do you mean? I didn't see
him go away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: No, he went away while you were
gone to the woods with your father's lunch. This is his
birthday, so I let him walk to Gentryville to get me some
thread. You folks wear out your clothes so fast that
it takes a lot of thread to keep you from being bundles
of rags.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>sulkily</i>): And must I get that wood in all
alone?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">« 73 »</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: That won't hurt you. Don't you remember
the other day when you had the tooth-ache, Abe
got in all the wood and wouldn't let you do a thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matilda</span> (<i>enters at left from behind cupboard</i>): Hurry
up, John, and bring in some wood, the fire is getting low.
Don't you feel chilly, mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: Yes, it is getting cold here. Run
along, John, that's a good boy. Abe will get it all in tomorrow
night, I'm sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span>: Yes, or else when he's rich and famous maybe
he'll let you live with him. Mother is so sure he's bound
to be a great man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>rising</i>): O, well, Abe's all right, I don't mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: Yes, you children like to laugh at the
things I say about Abe, but I know any boy&mdash;or girl
either, for that matter&mdash;who's so anxious to learn, can't
help amounting to something some day. You just wait
and see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span> (<i>enters at right</i>): What's that, mother?
What shall we see if we wait? Guess we'll have to wait
a good while if we see anything very great around these
diggings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span>: O, ma's just bragging about Abe again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span> (<i>goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span> <i>and lays hand
on her shoulder</i>): You're good to the chap, Sallie, that's
a fact. I'm glad I brought you here to be a mother to
him. But sometimes I wonder if it's just the thing for
you to encourage him to do so much reading, for I know
you do encourage him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matilda</span>: I should say she does! Why, the rest of
us young ones have to go around on our tip-toes and
talk in whispers when Abe gets his nose in a book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>: Isn't that a little hard on the others,
Sallie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matilda</span> (<i>quickly</i>): Oh, my! <i>we</i> don't mind. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">« 74 »</a></span>
<i>like</i> to have Abe read, and we think he's mighty good to
tell the rest of us all about what he reads.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span>: That he does. You just ought to hear him,
pa, tell the story of Pilgrim's Progress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matilda</span>: O, pa wouldn't like that as well as he
would Æsop's Fables; just get him to tell you some of
<i>those</i> stories some time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: And all about Robinson Crusoe, too, pa, and
the queer times he had. You'd like <i>that</i>, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>: Well, it may be all right, but I don't
like to see a big, strapping boy like Abe spending his
time over books, to say nothing of the hours he wastes
running around borrowing them. Why, I'll bet he has
read every book in this county.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: So he has! He was wishing just
the other day that he knew of some more books that he
could borrow: he said he had "read every book that he
had heard of within a circuit of fifty miles."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matilda</span>: And, pa, if you could only hear him when
he climbs on the table and makes speeches. I just tell
you, Abe is heaps of fun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>: I dare say he is, but that doesn't get
the work done. It's all right for sickly fellows to be
spending their time getting learning, but a big, strong
fellow like Abe will always be able to earn his living
by hard work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: Of course he'll be <i>able</i> to, but you'll
find out he'll not do it. I tell you there are other plans
laid away in that big head of his.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>: Well, well, he'll have you to thank if
he ever does amount to anything, that's sure. (<i>Shivers.</i>)
But it's cold in here, what on earth is the matter with
your fire?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>aside</i>): Time for me to run. (<i>Exit at right,
hurriedly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">« 75 »</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span> (<i>turning toward cupboard</i>): It's funny
you young ones can't look after the fire when ma's busy.</p>

<p>John, you go bring in some wood! (<i>Looks around.</i>) O,
he's gone after it, I guess&mdash;about time. (<i>Disappears behind
cupboard.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span> (<i>to girls</i>): Don't tell pa that John
was waiting for Abe to help him. If you do they'll both
get a scolding, maybe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matilda</span>: And you, too, for letting Abe go away.
(<span class="smcap">All</span> <i>laugh</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>enters at right, carrying wood, which he drops
noisily behind cupboard</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span> (<i>starting up</i>): John, why do you drop
the wood in that noisy way? (<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>re-appears and
comes down</i>.) After all my talking to you, it does seem
as if you might learn to be more quiet about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matilda</span>: Yes, when Abe&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> (<i>catching her by the arm</i>): Hush, Matilda!
if you keep on (<i>they come down to right front</i>) you'll
make John hate Abe. Don't hold him up to John <i>all</i>
the time as a pattern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matilda</span> (<i>sighs</i>): But, you know, Sarah, Abe is so
different. He never does any of those disagreeable things
that John is always doing. I remember, when we first
came here, ma told Abe to take off his hat when he
came into the house, and she never has had to tell him the
second time; but she is still trying to hammer it into
John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span>: Yes, dear, I know, and Abe is so kind to
everyone and so thoughtful of other people's comfort.
I am so glad he is my brother, and I only wish I were
half as good and kind as he.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matilda</span>: Yes, and so jolly, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span>: Only sometimes he looks so sad&mdash;that must
be when he's hungry for more books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">« 76 »</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>coming towards them</i>): What are you two
girls talking about over here?</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span> <i>appears from behind cupboard, carrying
a large wooden shovel, the blade of which is covered
with black figures. He comes down, confronting</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>: Mother, what in the world is this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span> (<i>laughing</i>): O, those are Abe's sums.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>: Sums! I vum! Sums! What did he
make them with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: A piece of burnt wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>: I vum! Sums! Where did he learn
to <i>do</i> sums?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: O, he picked it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>: I bet you taught him! didn't you,
Sallie? Come now, own up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: Well, I helped him a little, but he's
far ahead of me now; he's ciphered clear through that
old ragged arithmetic that's been kicking around the
house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span> (<i>turning shovel over</i>): But both sides
are covered. What's he going to do now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>: O, he'll take the shaving knife and
whittle it all off, then he'll have a "new slate," as he
says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span> (<i>holding up shovel</i>): A new slate!
Sums! Well, I vum!</p>

<p>(<i>Whistle heard behind scenes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span> (<i>rising</i>): There he comes now. Put
the shovel away, and don't scold him, pa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>: Sums! I vum! (<i>Exit quickly behind
cupboard.</i>)</p>

<span class="smcap">John</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="smcap">Thomas</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="smcap">Helen</span><br />
</p>


<p class="caption4">COSTUMES</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The characters</span> wear suits made as nearly as possible in the style
of seventy years ago. For hints as to proper styles consult
pictures in old books&mdash;a brief description is, however, given.</p>

<p>The boys' trousers are long and loose; the jackets are short and
tight-fitting, with small sleeves. The jackets are made open in
front, and short, close-fitting vests, buttoning to the neck, are worn
under them. White turn-over collars surmount the whole. These
suits may be made of the cheapest material. Or, if preferred, the
boys may be arrayed in blue overalls and "jumpers"; this will
save much labor and inconvenience.</p>

<p>The girl wears a short, full-skirted gown of pink calico, the
waist made plain, fitting closely and buttoning up the back. The
hair should hang in two long braids, the ends tied together with a
green ribbon.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>SCENE</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The stage</span> is set to represent a schoolroom, with blackboards and
maps on the walls, and cheap plain benches and desks in an orderly
arrangement. A small pine table, on which are some books and
a hand-bell, is in the center. Behind this table is an old-fashioned
wooden chair for the teacher. Shabby and battered books are
piled neatly on the various desks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>enters at right, comes to one of the desks, seats
himself, and opens a book</i>): Here is this miserable
sum again. I suppose I've just <i>got</i> to get it done before
the teacher comes; but I can't make head or tail of the
thing. Let me see (<i>reads</i>): "If the half of four be
three, what will three-fourths of twenty be?" (<i>Closes
book with a bang.</i>) Was there ever any stuff like that?
Everybody knows that half of four can't be three, so
what's the use of wearing out a fellow's brains, 'specially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">« 78 »</a></span>
when he's like me and hasn't any to spare, over
a silly thing like that? O, gee, I believe I'll run away.
I hate this school, school, all the time. If father would
only let me stay at home and plough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span> (<i>enters at right</i>): What's that, Jack?
Didn't I hear you say something about ploughing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>rises and leaves desk, both boys come down</i>):
Yes, I was just wishing I could stay at home and plough
instead of coming to school and worrying my head over
fractions. I hate them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span> (<i>goes to another desk and takes up book</i>):
I don't mind fractions, but here's this awful geography
lesson. Teacher said if I didn't have it this morning
I'd have to stay in all the noon hour and learn it. What
good will it ever do me, I'd like to know, to get the
names of all these islands in my head? I don't mean to
be a sailor, and if I should be I guess I'd learn the
names of places fast enough when I came to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>puts his hand on</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas'</span> <i>shoulder</i>): Say,
Tom, let's run away where they can't make us go to
school. We know enough now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: So we do; we can write our names, and
say the multiplication table. What more need a fellow
know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: We can work for the farmers until we get a
little money and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> (<i>enters at right and comes down</i>): O boys,
aren't you ashamed? I overheard your bad plans; how
can you talk that way about going to school instead of
being glad that you have the chance to go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: <i>Glad</i> of the chance? Ho, ho, that's funny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: I should say so, as if anybody was ever
<i>glad</i> to go to school. (<i>Both boys laugh heartily.</i> <span class="smcap">Helen</span>
<i>stands silently gazing at them</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Why, that beats everything! "Glad to go to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">« 79 »</a></span>
school!" I don't believe there ever was such a thing as
a fellow being <i>glad</i> to go to school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: I'm sure I'm glad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span> (<i>snapping his fingers scornfully and turning
away</i>): Yes, but you're a <i>girl</i>. I suppose it's all right
for a <i>girl</i> to be glad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I said I didn't believe there was such a thing
as a <i>fellow</i> being glad to go to school. You're not a
fellow, are you? (<i>Both boys laugh and cross over.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: If I was a girl I dare say I'd like to go to
school. Of course, that's better than rocking the baby
and washing the dishes&mdash;but <i>fellows</i>! I tell you they
have better ways to pass their time, eh! Jackie? (<i>Pokes
him in the ribs. Both laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: Well, it's a lucky thing for the world that
all boys aren't like you, else where would our great men
come from if all the boys were as willing to remain great
know-nothings as you two are?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: O, who wants to be great? Great men have
to work, and to sit up nights and worry about things. I'd
rather be a plough-boy than a great man any time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: So would I! Nothing to worry about, just
follow the horse and keep the plough straight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: Well, there's one thing of which both of you
may be pretty sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Both</span>: What's that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: You are in a fair way to get what you want.
You will both be plough-boys until you are too old to
hold the plough, and then you can go to the poorhouse,
where the "great men" whom you despise will make
laws to take care of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: That's just it; now you are coming around
to John's statement. We will not have to worry; others
will do that, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> (<i>impatiently</i>): Boys, why don't you brace up
and study as you ought to? What's the use of all this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">« 80 »</a></span>
foolish talk? You know you don't mean a word of it!
(<i>Goes up stage.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: We do mean it, too, don't we, Tom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: <i>You're</i> the one that talks foolishness. You
said some boys would be "glad of our chance to go to
school."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> (<i>coming down quickly</i>): Yes, and it's true,
too. I heard my father telling last night about a boy
living out in the woods beyond Gentryville who'd give
almost anything for your chance. He's never been to
school but a few months in his whole life, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: O, no wonder he thinks he'd like it, he
doesn't know anything about it. I thought it was fun,
too, when I was in the primer class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Yes, so did I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: Well, he's beyond the primer class, I tell
you. He knows the old Webster spelling book all by
heart, father says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: How'd he learn it if he hasn't been to school?
Your stories don't hitch very well, Miss Preachie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: He learned it all by himself, lying on the
floor nights in front of the big fireplace. They are too
poor to have even a grease light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: Must think a lot of that old spelling book.
(<i>Both laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: Of course he thinks a lot of it. He thinks
a lot of <i>any</i> book. Father heard a man telling down at
the store that this boy cut four cords of wood for some
one, just to get a <i>piece</i> of a book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: O, wanted to read the Arabian Nights, probably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: But it wasn't the Arabian Nights that he
bought; it was the Life of Washington.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: What's the use of <i>his</i> reading the Life of
Washington? He's nothing but poor, white trash&mdash;too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span>
poor, you say, even to have a grease light. He'll never
be anybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: Don't you be too sure of that. I tell you
that boy will be a great man. Some day you'll hear of
him yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Just because he was fool enough to cut four
cords of wood for a <i>piece</i> of a book?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: Well, I'd have had the whole book or
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: So would I (<i>sneering</i>). Why he was a fool.
O, yes, we'll hear of him, of course. We'll read about
him in the back part of the spelling book where the
blank leaves are. But what's his name, do you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: Yes, father told me. His name is Abraham
Lincoln: remember it, boys, for I am quite sure you
will hear it again some day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: Of course we'll remember it; couldn't forget
it if we tried. A boy that was as big a greeny as
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I tell you, Helen, the next time that you have
to write one of those things which you like so well&mdash;a
composition&mdash;you can write it about "The Two Cuts, or
The Wood That Was Cut for a Cut Book." My! but
that will be fine. (<i>Both laugh boisterously.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: Well, you may laugh, boys, but you'll find
there'll be plenty of people to write about him, and it
may be it will be done while you are yet alive to read the
books, and more than that&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>Shouts heard from behind scenes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>running off at right</i>): Come on, Tom, I hear
the boys forming for "There, old cat"; we'll be too late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: But, how about your sum and my geography
lesson? The teacher'll do something dreadful
to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>calling back over his shoulder</i>): Bother on
them, we'll have time to study after school calls: if we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">« 82 »</a></span>
don't, who cares? Let Abraham Lincoln do the studying
while we are having fun. Come on, come on. (<i>Exit
at right.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: Don't go, Tom; stay and have a perfect
lesson for once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>: O, I've heard preaching enough for one
morning. (<i>Exit at right, running.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>: That's the way it always ends. If I try to
have them mend their ways, they just make fun of me
for "preaching." (<i>Goes to a desk and takes up book,
opens it and sits at desk.</i>) I'm only a girl, of course,
but I am going to imitate poor Abe by trying to get a
little knowledge into my head. But what foolish boys
<i>they</i> are, and some day when Abraham Lincoln is a
great man and everyone is talking about the wonderful
things he is doing, John and Tom will be standing
around whittling sticks and growling because they
couldn't be as "lucky as Abraham Lincoln." Well, if <i>I</i>
am anywhere around, I'll tell them of the things they
said this morning. I know I shall never forget them.

</p>


<p class="caption4">COSTUMES</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Soldiers</span>: For the four soldiers, suitable military outfits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian</span>: If a wig of long black hair is obtainable, part the
hair and make into two heavy braids, twisting yellow or red flannel
through the braids which hang down close to the face on either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">« 83 »</a></span>
side. If a wig is impossible, decorate a strip of pasteboard with
chicken feathers and fasten it around the head. Wear a brightly
colored blanket thrown over a pair of overalls and dark cotton
shirt. Wear moccasins. Carry old-fashioned gun.</p>

<p>The character of Lincoln must be taken by boy much taller than
the others.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>SCENE</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp</span>; tent in foreground with flap up, showing rude bed, gun,
knapsack, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant Dash</span> and <span class="smcap">Sergeant Free</span> are discovered
lying at full length not far from tent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span> (<i>rising</i>): Well, I must say, I'm mighty
tired lying 'round here waiting for that boat to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span> (<i>yawns and rolls over</i>): Guess we'll never
get where the Indians are if we wait for that boat. Wish
we could all swim across the river. Captain Lincoln's
getting mighty tired of waiting, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: No wonder! Such an unruly lot as he
has to hold in check here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span>: Yes, think of his being blamed for that
rowdy crowd breaking into the storehouse and drinking
up all the whiskey. He didn't know a thing about it
until it was all over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span> (<i>walking up and down</i>): Yes, but you
see that's the way things go; he's at the head of the company
and he just has to stand the blame for all their
meannesses. I should think they'd be a little careful
of their doings for they all like him, or seem to, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span>: You see, they just didn't think, that's the
trouble with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: Perhaps they'll be more careful after
this, that is if they like him as well as they pretend to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span> (<i>jumping up</i>): Oh, that's all real; they like
him, you can depend on that. Didn't you ever hear how
he came to be captain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: No, I have often wondered about it,
for he's young for that position. Tell me all about it if
you can. (<i>Seats himself on ground near door of tent.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">« 84 »</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span>: Well, it was this way; it's not a very long
story, but I might as well sit down. (<i>Sits on other side
of door.</i>) You see, there were two fellows put up:
Kirkpatrick and Lincoln. The vote was taken in a field,
by directing the fellows at the command "march," to
gather around the one they wanted for captain. The
other fellow was a good deal older than Lincoln and I
s'pose most folks would say he was better fitted to be
captain, but's sure's you live a good big majority
went over to Lincoln's side. And I never saw a fellow
so tickled as Lincoln was! (<i>Slapping his knee with his
right hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: Well, now, they ought to stand by him
and not cut up any more rowdy tricks, to have him disgraced
by wearing a wooden sword. Better talk to them
just as soon as you get a chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span>: I will, sir, that I will. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Private
Dunn</span> <i>at left. He comes down and salutes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Private</span>: You just ought to have been up the road
with the boys a couple of hours ago. I tell you, we had
heaps of fun. Talk about Indians!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Private</span>: I guess not! the Captain was there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: Well, what <i>did</i> they do to make any
fun?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Private</span>: Well, they all ran at him with their guns,
yelling "Redskin! Scalp him! Kill him! He's what we're
after." Then the frightened old fellow drew from his
belt a letter and whined out "Me good Injun, me no harm
paleface. See&mdash;paper; from big white war chief." Someone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">« 85 »</a></span>
grabbed the letter and read it aloud. It was from
General Cass and said that the bearer Gerolomo was a
friendly Indian and that he must be given food and
shelter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: Forged letter, no doubt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span>: I bet he was a spy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Private</span>: That's just what the others said. They all
got around him and yelled "Shoot him! Kill him!" till I
didn't think the poor beggar's life was worth two bits.
He thought so, too, I guess, for he was so scared that
he was almost white. They were all around him so that
he couldn't run&mdash;tell you it looked tough. (<i>Draws long
breath.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: But go on; you said they didn't kill
the worthless cur?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Private</span>: "Worthless cur!" Well, I guess not! the
Captain heard the men and dashing in among them, he
laid his hand on the Indian's shoulder, and he just
roared: "The first man that touches him dies!" O, boys,
you'd orter been there. (<i>Goes up.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span>: Come back and tell the rest; what happened
then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Private</span> (<i>comes down</i>): Someone sung out, "O,
you're a coward, afraid of an old Indian. Let <i>us</i> have
him!" Whew! You'd orter seen him <i>then</i>. I never
see the Captain so mad. "Who says I'm a coward?" he
roared, rolling up his sleeves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: Well, did they fight him? (<i>Laughs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Private</span>: Guess not&mdash;didn't want to tackle that job.
So the Captain after a minute or two took the old Indian
by the arm and led him off to feed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span>: That was just like the Captain, but it may
be the old fellow is a spy after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: Well, I guess that's the only Indian
that we are likely to see and it's too bad of the Captain
to spoil the boys' fun. O, here comes the noble red man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span>
now. (<span class="smcap">Gerolomo</span> <i>enters at right, comes down slowly
and timidly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: Hullo, there, you redskin! What's your
name? (<i>Goes to him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian</span>: Gerolomo. Me heap good Injun; heap like
paleface, bring paleface heap meat. (<i>Shows gun and
continues to move on slowly across stage.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: Stand still, there, and tell us where
the rest of your people are; we'd like pretty well to kill a
few hundred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian</span> (<i>stands</i>): Big paleface tell Gerolomo go
bring venison, go bring duck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: Well, why don't you do it, then? Better
mind him, I tell you, or he'll have you shot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian</span> (<i>shaking head decidedly</i>): No, no, big paleface
heap good, heap brave; no harm poor Injun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span> (<i>going to</i> <span class="smcap">Indian</span>): You're off now, I'll
bet, to tell your people just where to find us and just how
many palefaces there are here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian</span> (<i>repeats former business</i>): No, no, Gerolomo
go tell big paleface got venison, got duck, got squirrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Private</span> (<i>going to him and shaking his fist at him</i>):
None o' your lying now. If you go to the Captain with
that yarn he'll make short work o' you. The Captain
hates a liar, he does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian</span> (<i>whining</i>): Me no lie, me good Injun. Me
go tell big paleface me bring venison, me bring duck, me
bring squirrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span> (<i>to the others</i>): Listen to that, will you?
He'll bring venison, he'll bring duck, he'll bring squirrel.
My! but we'll be living high. (<span class="smcap">All</span> <i>laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span>: We'd like to <i>see</i> your venison, your duck,
and your squirrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian</span> (<i>briskly</i>): All right, me bring 'em in, me
bring heap meat. (<i>Turns about and moves toward right
exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">« 87 »</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: Better go with him, Dunn, because if
he is lying to us, which he probably is, he'll not come
back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Private</span>: All right, come on you "heap good Injun."
We'll see what you've got out there. (<i>Exeunt.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span> (<i>saluting</i>): Hadn't I better go, too, Lieutenant?
He may get away from Dunn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: No, I think Dunn can manage him.
But hasn't he learned the trick of telling a good lie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergeant</span>: I should think so. Venison, duck and
squirrel, and he's only been in the woods a few hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: Well, of course he may be telling the
truth, because the woods are full of game, and I daresay
the old fellow is a good shot.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Private Dunn</span>, <i>carrying a squirrel in one
hand, a duck in the other, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Gerolomo</span> <i>dragging
a dead deer. They stop at center.</i> <span class="smcap">Lieutenant
Dash</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sergeant Free</span> <i>run to them.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>: Well, really, you old redskin you have
told the truth for once in your life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian</span> (<i>lifting his hands and eyes</i>): Me shoot for
big paleface. Great Spirit tell Gerolomo where venison,
where duck, where squirrel for big paleface. Great Spirit
always take care of big paleface. (<span class="smcap">Captain Lincoln</span>
<i>enters at left and comes down slowly, unseen by</i> <span class="smcap">Gerolomo</span>.
<i>The others salute.</i>) Big paleface take care poor
old Gerolomo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Lincoln</span> (<i>goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Indian</span> <i>and lays hand on
his shoulder</i>): You have obeyed my orders and kept
your promise, the whitest soldier among us all could have
done no better.</p>

<p class="caption4">COSTUMES</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> and <span class="smcap">Sally Caroline</span>: For these two characters
borrow dresses made during the '60's. If this is impossible, make
gowns of some cheap yet good-looking material to represent such.
Let the skirt be very full and worn over hoops; the waist plain
and tight-fitting with wide flowing sleeves with white muslin undersleeves.
Wear a broad, flat, embroidered collar. Mrs. Mortimer
wears her hair parted in the middle, two curls on either side of
her face, held in place by side-combs; the remainder fastened
in a knot at the back. Sally Caroline's hair hangs in curls. Let
these costumes be planned and overlooked by a skillful matron who
is at least sixty years of age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>: In first act he wears an ordinary suit for young man;
in second act butternut-color suit, ragged and soiled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span>: Bright-colored print gown, wide gingham apron,
bright bandanna kerchief tied on head. This character should be
represented by a stout person, if possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Washington Augustus</span>: Overalls and "jumper" of
blue denim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clementina Diana</span>: Cotton gown. The two last named must
wear negro wigs or wigs of black wool. The characters making-up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">« 89 »</a></span>
for negroes should cover the faces with some sort of toilet cream
before applying the burnt cork or "black-face" preparation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> (<i>enters at left carrying open letter</i>): Poor
Cousin Bessie Helen, she has left her beautiful Alabama
home with all its grand furniture and has run away with
her brothers and sisters to grandpa's home here in Tennessee.
What a foolish thing for her to do. (<i>Reads from
letter</i>): "When they told me the Yankee soldiers were
coming I couldn't think of anything but to get away
safely with the children before the soldiers came in and
butchered us all." How <i>foolish</i> she was! I am sure the
officers would have seen that she came to no harm. (<i>Goes
to Lincoln's portrait and places her hand upon it.</i>) It is
plain that she has never looked upon <i>your</i> noble face. If
she had she would have felt, as I do, that at least some
small measure of your beautiful spirit must be scattered
abroad through your army to keep the men from harming
helpless widows and children. But, poor Bessie! she
has only heard dreadful stories about you, and so, with
her mother in her grave, and her father fighting against
the Yankees she could see no safety except in flight. I
must write to her and tell her something of our beloved
Lincoln and the army which he controls. (<span class="smcap">Albert</span> <i>enters
at left.</i>) O, Albert, I am so glad you have come in
just now. I have here a letter from Cousin Bessie; she
is at grandfather's here in Tennessee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>: In Tennessee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: Yes, read her letter; she was so afraid of the
Yankee soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>: And well she might be, the hounds!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: Hush! (<i>placing right-hand forefinger to
lips</i>): Albert, do you forget that our father is one of
them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">« 92 »</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span> (<i>walking up and down excitedly</i>): Indeed, I
<i>don't</i> forget! I think of it every hour, and it is <i>that</i>
which makes me so furious. How can he accept those
low-down Northerners as his associates?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: Brother, be still! Look at that face! (<i>Points
to Lincoln's portrait.</i>) <i>He</i> is a Northerner, altho' he
was born in Kentucky, and for his sake I love them all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>: Then you must hate all your friends and
relatives that are fighting against him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: No, no, dear brother, I do not. Don't you
remember how the grand Lincoln closed his inaugural
address? "We are not enemies, but friends. We must
not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it
must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords
of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot
grave, to every living heart and hearthstone,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span> (<i>interrupting</i>): There, stop, I will not listen
to any more of his stuff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> (<i>continuing rapidly</i>): "All over this broad
land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again
touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of
our nature." Are those not wonderful words?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>: Stuff and sentimentalism, that's what they
are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: O, Albert, how can you talk so? Think of it!
Today is his birthday; today you should delight to
honor him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>: His birthday! Who cares?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: Everyone should give thanks for this day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span> (<i>laughing</i>): What nonsense you talk, Sally
Caroline.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: Well, you will see. The time will come when
the Country will celebrate his birthday just as they now
do Washington's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>: O, come now, that's too much. It's bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">« 93 »</a></span>
enough to know that we are to have another four years
of his tyranny, without hearing you sing his praises.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: But, you'll <i>have</i> to hear it; the war will soon
be over, and he will be proclaimed as the Savior of his
Country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>: O, stop! The war is not anywhere near
over: it is but begun. I'll not listen to this talk any
longer. I resent it. I'll not hear any more of Abraham
Lincoln. (<i>Goes up stage in great excitement.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> (<i>excitedly</i>): Why, Albert! How can you talk
so? Why you sound just like a rebel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span> (<i>turns and coming to center stands</i>): And
that is just what I am, a rebel! A rebel against the
tyranny of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>drops into rocking-chair at left-front; buries
her face in her handkerchief and sobs violently.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span> (<i>comes down</i>): There, there, little sister!
don't take on so; surely you have known my sentiments
before this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> (<i>rising</i>): O, but you never talked quite so
wickedly before. How could you say things like that
with his noble, benign face looking straight at you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span> (<i>scornfully</i>): Noble, benign face, indeed!
I'll tear it into ribbons. I have put up with this thing
long enough. (<i>He goes toward picture.</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>runs
quickly, intercepts him, and stands in front of picture,
placing her arms protectingly across it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>: Stand aside!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: Never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span> (<i>loudly</i>): Stand aside, I say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: Never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> (<i>enters at right</i>): Children, what in
the world are you doing? Albert, was that you speaking
like that to your sister? I could hardly believe my ears.
(<span class="smcap">Albert</span> <i>goes to sofa and buries his face in his hands.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">« 94 »</a></span>
What in the world are you doing, Sally Caroline? Come
and sit down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: No, mother, not until Albert promises me
that he will not molest this picture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>: Molest that picture! Why should
he? Your father paid ten good dollars of United States
money for that picture and I reckon Albert doesn't want
to waste money like that. Come here, Albert. (<i>She sits
in rocking-chair at right-front.</i>) Do come away from
that picture, Sally Caroline; how ridiculous you look
spread out there. Come away, I say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: No, mother; not until Albert promises me
that he will not harm this picture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>: Of course he will not harm it. I
can answer for that. Harm a picture which his father
loves so well? I cannot imagine my son doing a deed
like that. Albert, come to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span> (<i>rising</i>): Mother, I see that I have no place
here. I will get across the line some way this very day,
and join the Confederate Army. (<b>Sally</b> <i>runs to him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> (<i>rises</i>): What! My son fight against
the old flag?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: Albert, Albert; O, you cannot mean it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>: Mother, you are a Southern woman; you
ought to bid me godspeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>: Yes, I am a Southern woman, but
I am the descendant of men who helped to bind these
States together, and no child of mine shall, with my consent,
help to sever them. You shall <i>not</i> go, Albert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>: Mother, I must! I shall&mdash;go. (<i>Exit at
right, running.</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> <i>throw their
arms about each other and sink upon the sofa.</i>)</p>

<p class="caption4">ACT II</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fife</span> and drum heard playing <span class="smcap">YANKEE DOODLE</span>, behind

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span>: Never seen nuthin' lak dem chilluns.
Dat dere Clementina Diana she's jes' nuthin' but a no-'count
shif'less niggah eber sence dem Linkum sojas

he des poun' de old drum. O, deah, mighty queah times
when niggahs jes' tinks dey's got nuthin' to do but stan'
'round and make jig music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> (<i>enters at right</i>): Aunt Temp, those
children of yours can make pretty good music. I think
we'll have to send them to that new Fisk University, just
founded. (<i>Sits in rocking-chair at right-front.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span>: Lan' sakes alive, Miss' Em'line! what
de wo'ld you-all do dat foh? Suah dem chilluns ain't
done nuthin' foh to shet dem up in de what ye call it,
tentiarity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>: O, Aunt Temp, I didn't say the
<i>Penitentiary</i>. I said the <i>University</i>; that's where they
educate the darkies, you know, and when they are natural
musicians like your children, they teach them all the
branches of music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span>: What! eddicate de niggahs! I hain't
nevah seen no good come o' dat. I'll eddicate that Gawge
Washington Augustus to saw wood, and Clementina
Diana has jes' nachually <i>got</i> to lea'n to make a hoe-cake

nuthin' else. Lan' sakes, I reckon what's good enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">« 96 »</a></span>
for dere ole niggah mammy 's good enough for dem two
black niggahs. (<i>Placing arms akimbo and holding head
up proudly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>: But everything's changed now, you
know, Aunt Temp: there aren't any slaves any more, and
so we must teach you colored people to take care of yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span>: Yes, I know, I yerd lots o' dat kin'
o' talk jes' dese yere days, but I reckon I jes' stays right
heah wif you-alls twell I dies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clementina</span> (<i>running in from right</i>): O, mammy,

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span>: Go 'long ye good-foh-nuthin' shif'less
niggah; doan ye see de mist'ess?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clementina</span> (<i>turns and ducks her head and shoulders:
a rude imitation of a curtsy</i>): O, 'scuse me Miss'
Em'line. I was jes' plum' crazy ovah dat fife. Golly,
but dat's fine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>: You can play as well as a man,
Clementina: come here. (<span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> <i>takes</i>
<span class="smcap">Clementina's</span> <i>hand and leads her to Lincoln's picture.</i>)
Do you know who this is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clementina</span> (<i>looking very serious</i>): Suah I duz,
Miss' Em'line; dis heah (<i>lays her hand on picture</i>) is de
good Massa Linkum what said to all de people eve'ywha's,
up in the Norf 'n' down in de Souf, dat dere
shouldn't nevah no moah be any slaves anywha's. (<i>Joyfully
and enthusiastically</i>): Golly, but I's glad he done
libed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> (<i>bowing head sorrowfully and speaking
slowly and softly</i>): Yes, indeed, we are all glad of
that: and now you may go, Clementine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clementina</span> (<i>comes down while</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> <i>remains
looking at picture.</i> <span class="smcap">Clementina</span>, <i>when near right
exit, turns and runs back to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>): O, I say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">« 97 »</a></span>
Miss' Em'line, de good Marsa Linkum done gone dead
now, an' won't dey take us all back foh slaves ag'in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> (<i>coming down</i>): No, you poor child,
don't be afraid, slavery is done with forever and forever.
No one can ever undo the work of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clementina</span>: Golly! I's glad o' dat. Bress de Lawd
foh Abraham Linkum. (<i>Dances a few steps and then
exits at right, running.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span>: She hain't got no sense Miss' Em'line,
so you-all mus' jes' nachually fohgive her foh jes' fohgettin'
'bout what all dis yere wah cost you-all. (<i>Bowing
head and speaking softly and sadly.</i>) But I knows,
I knows, Miss' Em'line, an' I's powe'ful sorry foh
you-all. (<i>Exit at right, head still bowed.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> (<i>sits in rocking-chair at right-front</i>):
Yes, the cost <i>has</i> been great (<i>speaking slowly and weighing
each word carefully</i>), O, how great! and our noble
leader who said he now longed only to bind up the Nation's
wounds has been taken from us. How will it be
now, I wonder? They tell me the war is over. Lee has
surrendered&mdash;but where, O where (<i>rises and walks up
and down</i>) are my poor husband and our boy? It has
been long since I have had a letter from either. Perhaps
they have both died fighting for the cause in which each
believed. Poor, misguided Albert! how could he ever
have gone against the flag of his forefathers? (<i>Exit at
left.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George</span> (<i>enters at right</i>): Dat air Clementina Diana's
jes' too much for my institution. She dinks 'case Miss'
Em'line told her she done play de fife's good as a man
dat she's de bigges' pickanninny on dis yere plantation.
But I'll show her she cain't come none o' her friskom-fa'i'cation
ovah Gawge Washington Augustus. Dis yere

li'l' niggah gal what's what. (<i>Fife behind scenes.</i>) Dah

de matta, you crazy niggah gal? Ye des done gone out

<p><span class="smcap">Clementina</span>: Git yore dwum, Gawge Washington

<p><span class="smcap">George</span>: O, go 'long wif yore crazy talk, de massa's
done gone de'd befoh dis yere. Ye s'pose he lib an' not
sen' a perscripshun to de mist'ess befoh dis yere? No,
dem mis'able reb bullets get him foh dis yere. I knows.
(<i>Pointing finger at her</i>): Go 'long wid ye now! (<i>Goes

<p><span class="smcap">Clementina</span>: Now, doan ye be so sma't, Gawge
Washington 'Gustus; he's comin' foh suah&mdash;I seed 'im.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George</span> (<i>comes down quickly</i>): Seed 'im? Ya mis'able
good-foh-nuthin' lyin' niggah gal, how could ye seed 'im?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clementina</span> (<i>slowly and solemnly</i>): I seed a tramp
comin' 'way obah de fields. I kin'a sca'd an' 'spishus.
I tak Miss' Em'line's spy-glass and I looked and I seed
'twas marsa. (<i>Dances a few steps, singing</i>, "Marsa's
come." <i>They both run out at right. Fife and drum is
heard, playing</i> <span class="smcap">YANKEE DOODLE</span> <i>behind scenes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> (<i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span>, <i>run in at left</i>): I was
sure I heard Clem's voice singing, "Marsa come," but
there's no one here. O, why did she do it? (<i>Drops into
rocking-chair at left-front.</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>runs to her.</i>) It was
wicked of her to do a thing like that. And that dreadful
tune! Sally Caroline, I think you'll have to go out and
make them keep still. (<i>Music grows fainter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: Never mind, mother dear, they are going
away now. They'll soon be out of hearing. I'll see what
they are about. (<i>Exits at right.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>: I never, never, want to hear that
tune again. I shall always associate it with this bitter
disappointment. O, I was so sure my poor husband
had come. I wonder what made the child think of singing
that? But, then, she is only a child; she cannot understand
(<i>buries her face in handkerchief and sobs</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">« 99 »</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span> (<i>enters at left and goes to side of</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>): O, now, Miss' Em'line! Doan,
honey, doan do dat, pore soul. Yore ole mammy knows
jes' how't feels&mdash;come, now, obah heah on de sofi, an'
hab a good rest. (<i>Puts arms about her and leads her
to sofa, putting pillow under her head, etc., while talking
to her.</i>) Dere, dere, honey, doan ye feel bad any moah.
We-all tak de bes' caah of ye an' make ye des's happy as

Car'line, de lubliest angel anybuddy eber seed; she done

Miss' Em'line. Come, now, honey, tu'n obah an' go
a-sleep, yore ole mammy covah ye up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>: And, Auntie Temp, don't ever let
those children play Yankee Doodle around the house
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span>: Dat I won't, honey, I'll go this
minnit an' see 'bout it. (<i>Comes down stage.</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>enters
at right. They meet at right-front.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> (<i>in excited undertone</i>): Auntie Temp, what
do you think? (<i>Catches her by the arm and dances and
jumps around in glee.</i>) Father is coming across the
field from the west! Your children have gone to meet
him. And as I was looking around, I saw another figure
coming slowly from the south. I took the glass, which
was lying on the porch, and it is Albert!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span> (<i>excitedly</i>): Laws honey, ye doan
mean it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: Hush! I am afraid the excitement will be
too much for mother. O, what shall we do? They may
come rushing in any minute. (<i>Fife and drum heard.</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> <i>groans.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span>: See to yore pore ma, Miss Sally
Car'line, I got ter make dem niggahs shet up. (<i>Exit at
right. Music ceases in a moment.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> (<i>sitting up</i>): O, good Auntie Temp!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">« 100 »</a></span>
What a comfort she is to me; she promised to make those
children stop that tune and she has done it. (<i>Sighs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> (<i>kneeling beside her</i>): But, mother dear,
wouldn't you like to hear the fife and drum playing
Yankee Doodle if it was played for joy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> (<i>jumping up</i>): For joy? What can
you mean, Sally Caroline?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> (<i>rising and throwing arms about</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>):
Don't get excited. It means, dearest mother,
that you are to be happy again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>: O, Sally Caroline, don't deceive
me! Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> (<i>interrupting</i>): Yes, yes, it means that they
(<i>leads her slowly toward right exit</i>) are both coming
across the fields: one from the west and one from the
south, and, even now, they may be in the door-yard.
(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span> <i>hurries.</i>) There, there, dear, do not
overtax your strength. Remember, too, they are much
changed, and you mustn't give 'way when you meet
them. (<i>Exeunt at right.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clementina</span> (<i>enters at right, waving fife, followed
by</i> <span class="smcap">George</span>, <i>carrying drum</i>): Golly, wa'n't that fine?
Seems lak I cu'd jes' dance mah feet off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George</span>: Well, ye jes' keep still, ye good-foh-nuthin'
niggah gal. Nebah seed sich a crazy gal nowahs, Dere,

<p>(<span class="smcap">Clementina</span> <i>runs up and stands behind Lincoln's

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mortimer</span>: It seems too good to be true that
I have <i>both</i> my dear ones at home again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span> (<i>breaks away from his mother and runs to
Lincoln's portrait, laying his hand upon it</i>): And,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">« 101 »</a></span>
mother, I am cured of my folly. I have seen him, and
I am glad the old flag was victorious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> (<i>excitedly</i>): Have <i>seen</i> him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>: O, tell us about him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span> (<i>coming down</i>): <a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>It was at Richmond. I
had been taken prisoner with two other young fellows.
We were shut up in an old store. The President came
there with some of his friends and just a few of his
sailors. He passed the store and saw us staring from
the window. O, the look that came over his face I can
never describe, as he called out: "Break in that door
and let those boys go home to their mothers." In a
second we were free.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_J_10" id="Footnote_J_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_J_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> This incident is purely fictitious and is given only as what might
have happened, being quite in keeping with Lincoln's character.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span>: De Lawd bress him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>: And, mother, when I stood face to face
with him I saw that not half had been told me of his
goodness and his greatness. And when I heard of his
death a day or two ago, as I was begging my way across
the country, to get home, I wept like a child. I knew
then, as others will know later, that this was the end
of life for the greatest American this country ever had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span>: De Lawd save us! I's mighty scar'd
o' what 'comes of us pore niggahs now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> (<i>going to</i> <span class="smcap">Auntie Temp</span> <i>and putting hand on
her shoulder</i>): You have nothing to fear from this time
forth, Auntie Temp. Although Abraham Lincoln is
dead, his <i>spirit</i> will live <i>forever</i> in the land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span> (<i>comes to front-center</i>): Yes, and he has
taught the American Nation, in his own immortal words,
"that government of the people, by the people, for the
people, shall not perish from the earth."</p>

<p>At a signal from the principal the pupils in ordered
ranks, hands to the side, face the flag. At another
signal every pupil gives the flag the military salute
as follows: The right hand lifted, palm downward,
the forefinger touching the forehead above the eye.
Standing thus all repeat slowly: "I pledge allegiance
to my flag and the republic for which it
stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice
for all." At the words "to my flag," the right
hand is extended gracefully, palm upward towards
the flag, and remains in this gesture till the end of
the affirmation, whereupon all hands immediately
drop to the side. Where a silent salute is given, the
flag is borne between the standing lines or in front
of a single line, and the hands remain at salute until
the flag-bearer reaches the center of the room, when,
at a given signal, every hand is dropped.</p>

<p class="caption4">A PRIMARY FLAG DRILL FOR FIVE LITTLE GIRLS AND FIVE
LITTLE BOYS</p>


<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Costumes</span>: Each child carries a flag of fairly good size and wears
a soldier cap. The caps are made of red, white and blue tissue
paper and should be provided with an elastic cord that passes
under the chin to hold them in place. Children also wear on each
shoulder an epaulet, made of strips of cambric, an inch wide, one
white, one red and one blue, sewed up in a cluster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Music</span>: A patriotic march.</p>

<p>Children enter in two files, the boys coming on
at the right corner of front of stage and the girls
at the left corner of front. The boys march up
the right side, across back and down the left side of
stage, while the girls at the same time pass up the left
side, across back and down the right side of stage. On
reaching the corners of front the two lines pass diagonally
to center of back, first boy and first girl form
a couple, each two on reaching center of back do the
same, and the couples march down the center of stage
to the front. During the opening march the flag is held
in right hand, resting against right side, but on forming
couples each couple raises flags and holds them high,
staffs crossed. At the front the boys turn to right, girls
to left, pass to corners of front, up sides and on reaching
the back they form two lines across back of stage,
girls on front line with boys back of them. Mark time,
then march&mdash;five abreast&mdash;down to near-front of stage,
where the lines halt, and as they do so they stand far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">« 104 »</a></span>
enough apart to allow a person to pass between them.
During this march the flags have been held again at
right side, but now each one holds flag high. The boy
nearest left of stage now leads the boys along the line
of girls, going in front of the first one, back of the
second, in front of the third, back of the fourth, etc.
Boys return to places and halt, then girl nearest the right
of stage leads the line of girls along the line of boys,
going behind the first boy, in front of second, back of
third, etc. The girls return to places and halt, then all
hold flags with staff standing upright and resting on
left shoulder. All speak:</p>

<p class="poetry">
In times of peace dear Old Glory doth wave<br />
O'er homes and schools in this land of the brave;<br />
<br />
(<i>Hold flags out in front of bodies, staffs perpendicular.</i>)<br />
<br />
In times of trouble it stands for the Right,<br />
And says that Justice is greater than might;<br />
<br />
(<i>Raise flags and wave them above heads.</i>)<br />
<br />
In times of battle, its colors so bright<br />
Lead on to Victory, though fierce be the fight.<br />
</p>

<p>With flags held at right sides the girls now pass up
the right side of stage while boys pass up the left side.
At center of back form couples, raise flags and cross
staffs, march in couples down center of stage to front.
At front the first couple halts, second couple goes to
right of first and halts in line, third couple to left of
first, fourth couple to right of second, fifth to left of
third. If stage is large enough let them stand in straight
line across front, otherwise they can stand in curved line.
The children now speak, one at a time. Each one holds
the flag in position at right side until he or she speaks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Child</span> (holding flag extended, arm's length at
right side):</p>

<p class="poetry">
One little flag says children must be true;<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Child</span> (holding staff of flag horizontal along
left shoulder, flag hanging down lengthwise at left side;
first child now holds flag in same way):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">« 105 »</a></span></p>

<p class="poetry">
Two flags say that we must be honest, too.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third Child</span> (holding staff of flag diagonally across
chest, flag on left shoulder; first and second children
hold flags the same):</p>

<p class="poetry">
Three flags say boys and girls must upright live;<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourth Child</span> (staff of flag perpendicular and resting
on left shoulder; first three hold flags the same):</p>

<p class="poetry">
Four flags say, "Be unselfish when you give".<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fifth Child</span> (holding flag in left hand, extended at
left side; first four hold flags the same):</p>

<p class="poetry">
Five flags teach us, "Let Justice be your song";<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sixth Child</span> (holding flag same as No. 2, but on
right shoulder; first five children holding flags the
same):</p>

<p class="poetry">
Six flags say we must grow up brave and strong.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seventh Child</span> (holding flag as No. 3, but on right
shoulder; first six the same):</p>

<p class="poetry">
Seven flags say, "Be loyal to the Right";<br />

shoulder, while first seven hold flags the same):</p>

<p class="poetry">
Eight flags say, "Love your home with all your might".<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninth Child</span> (holding flag out in front of body, staff
perpendicular; first eight hold flags the same):</p>

<p class="poetry">
Nine flags say, "Do not idle time away";<br />

the right side of body; first nine hold flags the same):</p>

<p class="poetry">
Ten flags say we must study hard each day,<br />

<p>The center couple now marches down to center of
front, couple to its right follows, couple to left of first

couple last. All march, in couples, to corner of right
of stage, up right side, across to center of back, down

<p class="caption4">A FLAG SALUTE, MARCH AND DRILL FOR ELEVEN INTERMEDIATE
GRADE CHILDREN</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">One boy</span> carries a flag considerably larger than the other ten
carry. This boy we will call the Color-bearer. This march may
be given by eleven boys or by six boys and five girls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Music</span>: A patriotic march.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he children enter in single file at left corner of
the line, then, if girls take part, a girl next, then a
back of stage, Color-bearer with large flag leading
boy, etc. File marches across back of stage, back again to
left side, diagonally to right corner of front, back to left
corner of back, down left side, across front of stage,
back to left corner and up left side, thus:</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 270px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">« 107 »</a></span></p>

<p>Then from left corner of back pass to center of back,
down center of stage to front, where Color-bearer turns
to right, first girl to left, next boy to right, next girl to
left, etc. Pass to corners of front, up sides of stage,
across to center of back, where the Color-bearer remains
standing, while the next boy and first girl form a couple,
each two do the same, couples march down stage till first
couple is near front. Halt, couples face each other,
standing about three feet apart. The Color-bearer now
passes down between the two lines and halts at front of
stage, facing audience. The couple nearest back of stage
now marches down between lines, goes to right and halts,
next couple comes down and goes to left, etc., thus:</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 278px;">
<img src="images/page107.png" width="278" height="99" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The file stands in curved line back of Color-bearer.
Music changes to <span class="smcap">STAR-SPANGLED BANNER</span>. The children
in the line stand with flags held at right side, as during
the march, till the music gets to "Oh! say, does the star-spangled
banner still wave," when they raise flags and
wave them slowly, till close of music. The piece is played
through once and then music ceases, the Color-bearer
raises his flag, holding it quite high. The others take
flags in left hands and hold at left sides. When the
large flag is raised they all say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I pledge my head, (<i>touch head with right hand</i>) my
heart, (<i>lay hand over heart</i>) and my hand, (<i>raise
right hand</i>)</p>

<p>To loyally serve my native land; (<i>drop hand at side</i>)</p>

<p>I pledge my power, my honor, and my might (<i>step forward
with right foot</i>)</p>

<p>To keep my country's name forever bright. (<i>Step back
in line.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">« 108 »</a></span></p>

<p>I pledge the zeal and strength of this right hand (<i>raise
right hand</i>)</p>

<p>To keep Old Glory floating o'er our land. (<i>Point to flag.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The flags are now held in right hands, out in front of
bodies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A flag for the sailor, skimming the sea,</p>

<p>A flag for the soldier, guarding the lea,</p>

<p>A flag for the patriot, proud to be free,</p>

<p>A flag for <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, (<i>flags extended to audience</i>)
and a flag for <span class="smcap">ME</span>! (<i>At this
flags are laid lovingly across chests
and held with both hands.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flags are now waved above heads and the line exclaims:</p>

<p>"America forever! (<i>flags held out at right</i>) one nation
(<i>flags out at left</i>) one country, (<i>step forward and
hold flags high, pointing toward audience</i>) one flag!"</p>

<p>Step back in line and hold flags at right sides while the
chorus of <span class="smcap">COLUMBIA, THE GEM OF THE OCEAN</span>, is played
softly. At the conclusion of that the music changes to a
march. The Color-bearer leads and the others fall in line
back of him in the same order as on entering the stage at
beginning, passing in single file to right corner of front,
up right side, across back, half way down left side, then
across stage. The last four children halt in line, the
others pass up right side, across to center of back and
down center of stage. The Color-bearer halts in center,
the others take places and stand thus:</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 255px;">
<img src="images/page108.png" width="255" height="140" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">« 109 »</a></span></p>

<p>Nos. 8 and 9 face back of stage; 5, 6 and 7 face left;
10 and 11 face front; 2, 3 and 4 face right; then lines
march once around, No. 1 (Color-bearer) standing as
the pivot on which others turn. Keep lines perfectly
straight while marching, those on outside going faster
to preserve perfect movement. After rotating once, halt.
Color-bearer raises flag high, others raise flags and repeat:</p>

<p>
I pledge allegiance to my flag&mdash;the best in any land,<br />
And to the Republic for which this flag doth stand;<br />
One nation, indivisible, the pride of great and small,<br />
One flag, emblem of Liberty and Justice for us all.<br />
</p>

<p>Color-bearer then marches to front of line, in front
of No. 2, leads to right of stage, all following in order,
up to back, across to center of back, down to center,
where lines form thus:</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 252px;">
<img src="images/page109.png" width="252" height="138" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Lines march around, describing circle, those on outside a
large one and others smaller, then Color-bearer takes
position at back of stage, the others form two lines of
five each, across stage. Color-bearer gives following
orders, in sharp, quick tones:</p>

<p>Order, flag! Rest flag on floor at right side, holding
with right hand.</p>

<p>Carry, flag! Raise flag and hold in right hand, staff
nearly vertical, top resting against right shoulder, arm
straight at side.</p>

<p>Present, flag! Move flag to center of body, top in
front of face, grasp staff with left hand, also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">« 110 »</a></span></p>

<p>Left shoulder, flag! Flag placed on left shoulder.</p>

<p>Right shoulder, flag! Flag placed on right shoulder.</p>

<p>Carry, flag! As before.</p>

<p>Port, flag! Grasp staff a little below center, hold

shoulder.</p>

<p>Carry, flag! As before.</p>

<p>Parade, rest! Right foot six inches to rear, left knee

of body and grasp it at top with both hands.</p>

<p>Carry, flag! As before.</p>

<p>Surrender, flag! Lay flag on floor in front of body.</p>

<p>Recover, flag! Bend forward, pick up flag, hold it in

<p>Carry, flag! As before.</p>

<p>Fix, flag! Kneel on right knee and stand staff of flag
upon left knee, staff vertical.</p>

<p>Triumph, flag! Stand, wave flag high above head.</p>

<p>Color-bearer now marches down center of stage to
front, members fall in line back of him in same order
as on entering at beginning. At right corner of front
second boy steps up by first girl, third boy by second girl,
etc. Form couples, Color-bearer marching alone at head.
Pass up right side, across to center of back, down center
of stage, across to left corner front, up left side and off
stage.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Costumes</span>: Four girls wear red dresses, four wear white and
four blue. Each girl wears two streamers, about nine inches wide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">« 111 »</a></span>

<p class="caption4"><span class="smcap">March and Song</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Music</span>: A march.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">G</span>IRLS enter at back of stage, in single file, reds
first, then those in white and lastly the blues, one
streamer held in each hand, arms hanging at full
length at sides. March once around stage in a circle,
then on reaching center of back come down center of
stage to front, where first girl goes to right, second to
left, etc., pass to corners of front, up sides, across to
center of back, form couples and march down center of
stage in couples.</p>

<p>At front first couple turns to right, second to left, third

to right, etc., go to corners of front, up sides, across to
back, form fours and march down center to front. As
they reach the front in lines of four each, the three
girls nearest the right of stage&mdash;a red, a white and a blue&mdash;pass
to the right. As the girl in blue comes to front
before turning, the next three&mdash;a red, a white and a blue&mdash;follow
her. At the same time the three nearest the left
of stage pass to left corner and the next three follow
them. This makes two files of Red, White and Blue,
one from either side, which pass to corners of front, up
sides, then those passing up left side on reaching corner
of back march in a diagonal line to right corner of front,
while the others pass from right corner of back to left
corner of front. As the lines cross at center of stage
first girl from right goes in front of first girl from the
left, then second girl from right in front of second girl
from left, and so on. Each line crosses front of stage to
opposite corner, those from the right corner keeping to
the right of the other line as the files pass. March up
sides of stage, then across to center of back, where the
first three on the line that marched up right side form
the first row, the first three on the line from the left
side form the second row, second three from the right
form the third row and the others the fourth row, and
they march down center of stage three abreast, in the following
order : B, W, R, leading; R, W, B; B, W, R; R, W,
B. On reaching front of stage the three of first row pass
toward left corner, second row passes toward right corner,
next three follow the first row toward left and last
row follows second row to right. They stand in curved
line at front, thus:</p>

the other line standing until the last one of the right line
reaches front of stage, when the first one of the left-hand
line leads that line to front and they follow the first six,
making a single file which passes to right corner of stage,
up to center of right, whence the line marches thus:</p>

for girls to march around is reached, thus:</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 113px;">
<img src="images/page116.png" width="113" height="127" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When all are in a circle at center of stage, they raise hands
on inside of circle and point upward towards center,
hands touching, holding streamers. March once around
this way, then all turn and march in opposite direction,
once around in circle, raising the outside hands, and holding
streamers high. Then all turn and march in opposite
direction once around circle, this time raising both hands
up until fingers meet above head, lowering to side, raising
again, etc. Then those in red march to left corner
of front of stage, those in blue to right corner of front,
while those in white come down center to front. Those
in red pass across front to right corner as those in
blue pass to left corner. Those in white wait at front of
stage and as the reds and blues cross front two girls in
white follow the reds, the other two follow the blues, the
two lines pass up sides of stage and off at back.</p>

OF VARIOUS GRADES</p>


<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Characters and Costumes</span>: The part of Goddess of Liberty
should be taken by a young lady with strong voice who recites
well. She should dress in white, hair flowing, gilt crown, drapery
of red-white-and-blue, and carry a flag. If desired this part may
be taken by a boy dressed in patriotic costume to represent Uncle
Sam. Or a good effect is obtained by having both take part,
Liberty and Uncle Sam taking turns in reciting. If possible to
obtain so many, have twelve little girls take part in the Call of the
Flag march. These girls should be dressed in white with patriotic
sashes or red-white-and-blue streamers on left shoulder, and all
carry flags. The Response of the Soldier march is given by
twelve boys of various sizes, wearing dark suits, one of whom
carries a drum and the others carry guns. If desired some of
the same boys may take part in this who take part in the Blue and
Gray drill. The latter drill is given by at least sixteen boys,
grammar grade, eight of whom dress in blue and eight in gray.
One of the boys in blue carries a U. S. flag, and one of those in
gray carries a Confederate flag; the rest carry guns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">T</span>O THE strains of <span class="smcap">YANKEE DOODLE</span> the Goddess of
Liberty comes onto stage, marches down left side,
from left corner front in a diagonal line to center
of back, down to right corner front, up right side, across
to center of back and halts. Music ceases and the little
"flag girls" march in, half from each side of stage, half
way between Liberty and front of stage. The files pass
across stage and off at opposite sides, turn and march
on again, meet at center of stage, form couples, first
couple turns and passes off at right side, second couple
at left side, etc., thus:</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">« 118 »</a></span></p>

<p>The flag is carried in right hand, arm hanging at side,
flag resting against right shoulder. While this march
is being given as silently as possible, Liberty recites in
strong, clear voice and a great deal of feeling the following
medley:</p>

<p class="caption4">THE CALL OF THE FLAG</p>

<p class="poetry">
"Speed our Republic, O Father on high!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lead us in pathways of justice and right;</span><br />
Hail! three times hail to our country and flag!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Girdle with virtue the armor of might."</span><br />
<br />
"No refuge could save the hireling and slave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:</span><br />
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave."</span><br />
<br />
"'A song for our banner?' The watchword recall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which gave the Republic her station:</span><br />
'United we stand&mdash;divided we fall';<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It made and preserves us a nation."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Up with our banner bright,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sprinkled with starry light,</span><br />
Spread its fair emblems from mountain to shore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">While through the sounding sky</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Loud rings the Nation's cry&mdash;</span><br />
UNION AND LIBERTY! ONE EVERMORE!"<br />
</p>

<p>The girls' march should be arranged to close about
the time Liberty finishes speaking. One verse and chorus
of <span class="smcap">MARCHING THROUGH GEORGIA</span> is then played and as
music ceases the small boys come on and march in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">« 119 »</a></span>
same way as the girls did, the drummer boy beating time
softly, occasionally. While the boys march Liberty
speaks:</p>

<p class="caption4">THE RESPONSE OF THE SOLDIER</p>

<p class="poetry">
"<span class="smcap">War!</span> <span class="smcap">war!</span> <i>war!</i> Heaven aid the right!<br />
God move the hero's arm in the fearful fight!<br />
God send the women sleep in the long, long night."<br />
<br />
"Never or now! cries the blood of a nation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poured on the turf where the red rose should bloom.</span><br />
Now is the day and the hour of salvation;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never or now! peals the trumpet of doom!"</span><br />
<br />
"Lay down the axe, fling by the spade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leave in its track the toiling plough;</span><br />
The rifle and the bayonet-blade<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For arms like yours are fitter now:</span><br />
<br />
"And let the hands that ply the pen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quit the light task and learn to wield</span><br />
The horseman's crooked brand, and rein<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The charger on the battle-field."</span><br />
<br />
"And how can a man die better<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than facing fearful odds</span><br />
For the ashes of his fathers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the temple of his gods?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>As Liberty concludes the lines and the boys march off,
one verse and chorus of <span class="smcap">COLUMBIA, THE GEM OF THE
OCEAN</span>, is played, then music changed to a patriotic march
and the boys in Blue and Gray march on in two companies.
Grays come on at front corner of right and
Blues at front corner of left, march up sides of stage,
across to near-center of back, down to front of stage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">« 120 »</a></span>
to corners, up sides and at corners of back second boy
in each line steps up by first, fourth by third, etc., and
form double files. March to near-center of stage, down
center to front, up sides, and at corners of back each
company forms fours, march half way down stage and
halt in lines of four each, thus:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Liberty</span></p>

<p>The above lines are recited rather rapidly until number
17 is reached, the last four being given slowly and
sadly. When marching in the boys hold guns in right
hand, arm full length at side, gun resting against right
shoulder. While Liberty recites the boys go through
following movements, corresponding to the numbers of
the lines of the medley: 1. Salute, by raising left hand
until the forefinger touches forehead above left eye,
thumb and fingers extended, palm to right. Drop arm
at side. 2. Lines of Grays face left of stage, and Blues
face the right. 3 and 4. All mark time as if marching
rapidly. 5. Rest butt of gun on floor, arms hanging naturally
at sides, right hand holding the barrel between
thumb and fingers. 6. Raise gun and move to position
in front of body, barrel in front of face, hold with both
hands, left above the right. 7. Hold gun diagonally
across chest, barrel resting on left shoulder and butt
against right thigh. 8. Blues take steady aim at Grays,
and vice versa. 9. Arrange for some noise at side of
stage to represent firing. 10 and 11. Blues kneel and aim
at Grays, and vice versa. 12. More "booming" behind
scenes. 13. Rise and each company retreats backward
a step, holding guns at right sides. 14. Come forward
toward center, quickly, and aim. 15. Rest guns. 16.
Bring guns to position and mark time as if marching
rapidly. 17. Each company faces front of stage, stack
guns in lots of four each and then sit on floor in lines of
four, facing front of stage. Music is resumed and <span class="smcap">JOHN
BROWN'S BODY</span> is played through once, then Liberty steps
forward to front of stage and recites:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"The sun had sunk into the distant west;<br />
The cannon ceased to roar, which tell of rest&mdash;<br />
Rest from the shedding of a nation's blood,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">« 122 »</a></span>
Rest to lay their comrades 'neath the sod.<br />
<br />
"'Twas early spring, and calm and still the night;<br />
The moon had risen casting silvery light;<br />
On either side of stream the armies lay<br />
Waiting for morn to renew the fray.<br />
<br />
"The Rappahannock silently flowed on,<br />
Between the hills so fair to look upon;<br />
Whose dancing waters tingled with silvery light,<br />
Vied in their beauty with the starry night.<br />
<br />
"But list! from northern hills there steal along<br />
The softest strains of music and of song&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p>A good effect is obtained by turning off lights during
the music of <span class="smcap">JOHN BROWN'S BODY</span> so stage is dim during
the speaking and the singing. As Liberty pauses the
Boys in Blue sing a stanza of <span class="smcap">THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER</span>.
When they finish, the Boys in Gray sing a stanza
of <span class="smcap">DIXIE LAND</span>. It is a good plan to have a chorus of
voices behind the scenes help with the singing of both
songs, to give more force to them. As last song is finished
lights are turned on, Liberty resumes her place at
back of stage, boys rise, leave guns, Boy in Gray leaves
his Confederate flag, all march to near-front of stage and
form across in two lines of eight each, thus:</p>

<p class="caption4">
G B G B G B G B<br />
B G B G B G B G<br />
</p>

<p>The little girls in white who carried flags now march
in and stand in a row back of the boys, Liberty stands
just back of the line of girls.</p>

<p class="p0">Liberty recites:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"The fiercest agonies have the shortest reign,<br />
And after dreams of horror comes again<br />
The welcome morning with its rays of peace."<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">« 123 »</a></span></p>

<p class="p0">The little girls recite in concert:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"Peace! and no longer from its brazen portals<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The blast of War's great organ shakes the skies!</span><br />
But beautiful as songs of the immortals<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The holy melodies of love arise."</span><br />
</p>

<p class="p0">All the boys recite together:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"The union of lakes, the union of lands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The union of States none can sever;</span><br />
The union of hearts, the union of hands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the flag of our Union forever."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Liberty waves her flag, the girls with flags wave them
above the heads of the Boys in Blue and Gray, each boy
in blue joins right hand with a boy in gray, and everyone
sings the first stanza of <span class="smcap">MY COUNTRY, 'TIS OF THEE</span>.
Colored light may be thrown upon the scene for a tableau
and then the curtain dropped, or Liberty may come
to front of stage, lead the boys (who follow in single
file), and then the little girls last, once around the stage
and then off.</p>

fasten a large flag. Let the box stand four feet
from wall so as to leave room to pass behind it.</p>

<p>If possible have ten girls of good size, ten small girls
and ten boys take part, though this number may be reduced
if necessary. All the girls dress in white with
trimmings of red, white and blue and each carries a flag.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">« 124 »</a></span>
As the music of <span class="smcap">STAR-SPANGLED BANNER</span> begins the large
girls march on in two lines, half coming from right and
half from left. After them come the small girls, half
from each side, all march and take places thus:</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/page124.png" width="277" height="142" alt="" />
</div>

<p>They stand motionless, with flags at right side until
music reaches words, "Oh! say, does the star-spangled
banner still wave," then all raise flags and wave them.
As music of second stanza begins, the girls hold flags
again at sides, and the boys march in, each one carrying
an air-gun or rifle. They come on stage, half from right
and half from left, marching slowly and carefully. As
the boys get nearly to center of stage each girl quickly
raises her flag, takes aim with it as though it were a
gun, pointing it at line of boys. The boys stop as if in
fear, then pass quickly from stage, those from the right
going off at left, and those from left going off at right.
Then as the music reaches the refrain, sing the words of
third stanza instead of second, the boys helping behind
scenes and all singing with spirit, "And the star-spangled
banner in triumph shall wave, O'er the land of the free
and the home of the brave," the girls waving their flags.
A fine effect may be obtained by burning colored light<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>
during the singing.</p>

one hand a large flag and in the other six streamers made
of cambric: two white, two red, and two blue, three or
four inches wide and nearly two yards long. On either
side of Columbia stand three girls, dressed in white and
wearing sashes of red, white and blue, tied in a bow at
side. Columbia holds streamers by one end and each girl
holds the end of one. They stand thus:</p>

scenes, the verse by one person and the chorus by a number
of voices. Across the stage hang a curtain, leaving
room in front for a person to walk. A young man, or
tall boy, comes on stage with face blackened and wig of
curled hair (made by sewing curled hair onto a circular
piece of black cloth, then running a rubber cord around
edge and drawing up to fit head<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>), wearing stiff hat,

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">« 127 »</a></span></p>

<p>At close of chorus the impersonator goes to right corner
of front of stage and stands there during the second
stanza. The curtain is now drawn, revealing two little
darkey boys, scantily clothed, feet bare, and old hats on
heads. They chase each other across back of stage during
the words:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"All round de little farm I wandered<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I was young,</span><br />
Den many happy days I squander'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Many de songs I sung;</span><br />
When I was playing with my brudder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Happy was I;"</span><br />
</p>

<p>A girl with face blackened, bright cap on head, calico
dress, large apron, and bright kerchief around neck comes
on stage and one little darkey boy stands on either side of
her as the words are sung:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"Oh! take me to my kind old mudder,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dere let me live and die."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The mother and little boys stand at back of stage during
chorus, the young man comes out to near-center and
acts chorus as before, except at the words, "Far from
de old folks at home!" he turns and extends both arms
toward the group at back of stage.</p>

<p>As third stanza is begun the mother and boys pass off
and a young colored lady, gaily and gaudily dressed in
bright colors, with a large, "much-trimmed" hat, comes on
and stands at back of stage. She gazes off to side of
stage and a young man, dressed about like one who does
the acting, comes on carrying a banjo. She goes to meet
him, they walk back to center of back, she sits on a stump
of wood (or something to give an outdoor effect), and
he sits at her feet and pretends to play the banjo. During
the singing of this stanza the impersonator stands as before,
at side of stage, but as chorus begins he comes
toward center of front and acts as during second singing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">« 128 »</a></span>
of chorus. The mother and two boys come back on and
stand, tableau effect, beside the girl and boy with the
banjo.</p>


<p class="caption4">The Blue and the Gray</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hang</span> back of stage with black cloth and fasten on wall,
staffs crossed, two good-sized flags. A few feet from
the back, with about four feet aisle between them, arrange
two graves by using small boxes covered with dark
cloth for the mounds and nailing at the head of each a
white board for a stone. If it is not desired to have the
words sung they may be recited by someone at side of
stage. A girl dressed as a woman, all in black, comes on
slowly, passes across back of stage from left to right,
down right side, up to aisle between two mounds and
kneels beside one of them as the stanza is read:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"By the flow of the inland river,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whence the fleets of iron have fled,</span><br />
Where the blades of the grave-grass quiver,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Asleep are the ranks of the dead;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Under the sod and the dew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Waiting the judgment day;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Under the one, the Blue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Under the other, the Gray."</span><br />
</p>

<p>She rises and from a small basket which she carries she
places a bouquet on the mound by which she knelt, then
turns and places one on the other mound as the words
are read:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"From the silence of sorrowful hours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The desolate mourners go,</span><br />
Lovingly laden with flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alike for the friend and the foe;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Under the sod and the dew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Waiting the judgment day;</span><br />

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">« 129 »</a></span></p>

<p>As stanza is finished she passes to back and stands by
flags. Six girls in white, each carrying a small basket of
flowers, march on at left back, pass to center, then down
aisle between mounds to front; three turn to each side,
pass around and stand in two lines of three each, one line
on outside of each mound, both lines facing center, while
stanza is read:</p>

<p class="caption4">Auld Lang Syne</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> should be given by two as small children as can act
it nicely: a little girl with hair powdered, long dark dress,
white kerchief and apron, small black lace cap and spectacles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">« 130 »</a></span>
and a boy with glasses, powdered hair, long
trousers, coat fixed by sewing black "swallow tails" onto
a short dark coat, a white cravat and a stiff hat. As song
begins they sit at a small table on which are cups and
saucers and a tea-pot of tea. The girl pours out a cup of
tea for each during the words:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"Should auld acquaintance be forgot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never brought to mind?</span><br />
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And days of auld lang syne?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Then as the chorus is sung the boy rises and bows low,
then sits and they raise cups, clink them and each takes
a drink:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"For auld lang syne, my dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For auld lang syne;</span><br />
We'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For auld lang syne."</span><br />
</p>

<p>They lean forward and appear to be talking during the
words of second verse:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"We twa ha'e run aboot the braes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pu'd the gowans fine;</span><br />
But we've wandered mony a weary foot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sin' auld lang syne."</span><br />
</p>

<p>During singing of chorus second time the girl rises,
makes a courtesy to boy, then sits and they drink as
before.</p>

<p>They stand and shake hands during the stanza:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"And here's a hand, my trusty frien',<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gi'e's a hand o' thine;</span><br />
We'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For auld lang syne."</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">« 131 »</a></span></p>

<p>During the chorus each turns to table, takes up cup,
both bow, clink cups and drink.</p>


<p class="caption4">Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Words</span> are sung by a chorus of voices off stage. At center
of stage have a pedestal&mdash;box covered with dark cloth
will do&mdash;on which a girl dressed as Goddess of Liberty
stands, holding a large flag. A number of girls in white,
each with a small flag, come in and march in circle around
Liberty as the words are sung:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"Oh, Columbia, the gem of the ocean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The home of the brave and the free,</span><br />
The shrine of each patriot's devotion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A world offers homage to thee."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Six boys march in and stand three on each side of Liberty,
the line of girls standing back of the boys and waving
flags during words:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"Thy mandates make heroes assemble,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Liberty's form stands in view;</span><br />
Thy banners make tyranny tremble,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When borne by the red, white and blue."</span><br />
</p>

<p>During the chorus the boys stand in line in front of
Liberty and the girls march around them, waving flags.
Liberty waves flag also.</p>

<p>Half of the boys and half of the girls stand in lines on
either side of Liberty and give salute to flag during the
words<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"'Old Glory,' to greet now come hither,<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">« 132 »</a></span></p></div>

<p>Then during the rest of the third stanza and the chorus
the boys stand at back of Liberty, three on either side,
and the girls kneel in tableau effect in front of her.</p>


<p class="caption4">Home, Sweet Home</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At back</span> of stage arrange a family group around a small
table on which are some flowers and a lamp. The mother
is sewing, father reading, a little girl playing with a
dolly, and a boy working examples. All look happy and
cosy. As curtain is drawn revealing the scene, the first
stanza of <span class="smcap">HOME, SWEET HOME</span> is sung, and a young man
in soldier uniform, carrying a gun over shoulder,
marches back and forth across front of stage as if on
duty, looking sad and lonely.</p>

<p>(If desired, instead of a family group the scene may
disclose an elderly lady with bible on her knee.)</p>

has a hand on her shoulder as if trying to comfort her.

he recites:</p>

near. A march is played and after several measures
the others come onto stage. The line is led by boy
dressed as Uncle Sam, who takes position at center of
stage in front of tepee. On either side of him stands a
soldier, and next to the soldiers stand sailors. The others
arrange themselves in line, some on one side and some on
other, some sitting on floor in front of line. One, with
bible, dresses as minister, one as farmer with large straw
hat and rake over shoulder. One as doctor, one as baker,
one with tools as carpenter, etc. A girl dresses as nurse;
another with gown and mortar-bored cap as a student;
one has pen and scroll for writing; and another carries a
typewriter, sits on floor with it in front of her and pretends
to write on it. When all are in places colored light
is thrown on scene and Uncle Sam recites:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"Onward, forward, with steady pace,<br />
Progress leads the American race;<br />
And 'neath her penetrating ray<br />

head for turban, stands fastened to a box with a chain.
The box is covered with dark cloth and on it stands girl
dressed as Liberty&mdash;long white robe, crown, a drapery of
red, white and blue, and in her hand a flag. As light is
turned on she looks sadly at boy, then waves her flag
above him, and the chain which was lightly fastened
drops to floor as boy gives it a pull. He looks at fallen
chain, then sinks on knees and, raising hands, clasps
them and gazes at Liberty as if asking help. Liberty
waves flag above him.</p>


<p class="caption4">Peace</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On a dais</span> at back of stage sits boy costumed as Uncle
Sam, with a large flag. On one side of him stands Liberty,
in white with drapery of red, white and blue, and
gilt crown. On other side is Wisdom, wearing white
dress with purple mantle fastened on right shoulder,
bronze cap with plumes, sandals, and shield and spear by
her side. To a side and a little in advance of Liberty
stands Truth, all in white and carrying banner with
"Truth" printed on it. By Wisdom stands Justice, in
blue with scarlet mantle fastened on right shoulder and
thrown back over left arm. In her right hand she holds
a pair of scales and her left rests on a sword. Kneeling
at right corner of dais is Ceres, the goddess of corn and
harvests, dressed in yellow trimmed with grain, her left
hand on sheaf of wheat, her right holding a horn of
grain extended to Uncle Sam. Kneeling at left of dais
is Pomona, the goddess of fruits, dressed in red trimmed
with vines and clusters of grapes. She holds up to Uncle
Sam a basket of fruit. As light is turned on a stanza of

ill-fitting clothes, dark hair rumpled and pushed back
from forehead, sits writing as a rough-looking fellow
with whip in one hand tries to pull a little boy, face blackened
and poorly clothed, from his negro mother, who
clings to child and weeps. A boy marches on stage,
carrying large flag and recites:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"No slave beneath that starry flag,<br />

holding a flag. They repeat:</p>

<p class="poetry">
"He went about his work&mdash;such work as few<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ever had laid on head and heart and hand&mdash;</span><br />
As one who knows, where there's a task to do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Man's honest will must Heaven's good grace command.</span><br />
<br />
"So he went forth to battle, on the side<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That he felt clear was Liberty's and Right's,</span><br />
As in his peasant boyhood he had plied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His warfare with rude Nature's thwarting mights.</span><br />
<br />
"So he grew up, a destined work to do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lived to do it: four long-suffering years.</span><br />
Ill-fate, ill-feeling, ill-report lived through,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then he heard the hisses changed to cheers."</span><br />

<p class="caption3">WHY DUMMY CLOCKS MARK 8:18</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE are few who have not seen the ordinary
sign of a jeweler, an immense imitation of a watch
hanging over the front of the store. But it is safe
to say that the number who have ever detected anything
curious in these same signs is small. At 8:18 p. m.,
April 14, 1865, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in
Ford's Theatre at Washington by John Wilkes Booth.
Since that fatal night every one of these watch-signs that
has gone from the factory of the only man who makes
them has shown the hour of 8:18. The man who makes
them said: "I was working on a sign for Jeweler Adams,
who kept a store on Broadway across the street from
Stewart's. He came running in while I was at work and
told me the news. 'Paint those hands at the hour Lincoln
was shot, that the deed may never be forgotten,' he
said. I did so. Since then every watch-sign that has
gone out of here has been lettered the same as that one."</p>

<p class="caption3">LINCOLN'S TENDERNESS</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Lincoln was on his way to the National
Cemetery at Gettysburg, an old gentleman told
him that his only son fell on Little Round Top at
Gettysburg and he was going to look at the spot.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln replied: "You have been called on to
make a terrible sacrifice for the Union, and a visit to that
spot, I fear, will open your wounds afresh.</p>

<p>"But, oh, my dear sir, if we had reached the end of
such sacrifices, and had nothing left for us to do but to
place garlands on the graves of those who have already
fallen, we could give thanks even amidst our tears; but
when I think of the sacrifices of life yet to be offered, and
the hearts and homes yet to be made desolate before this
dreadful war is over, my heart is like lead within me, and
I feel at times like hiding in deep darkness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">« 149 »</a></span></p>

<p>At one of the stopping places of the train a beautiful
little girl, having a bunch of rosebuds in her hand, was
held up to an open window of the President's car, lisping,
"Flowerth for the Prethident." The President
stepped to the window, took the rosebuds, bent down and
kissed the child, saying: "You are a sweet little rosebud
yourself! I hope your life will open into perpetual
beauty and goodness."</p>


<p class="caption3">GRANTING A PARDON</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> story, probably better than any other, illustrates the noble
and sublime qualities of our great Lincoln. It is a forceful illustration
of his justice&mdash;justice tempered with mercy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">"W</span>ELL, my child," he said, in his pleasant, cheerful
tone, "what do you want so bright and
early in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Bennie's life, please," faltered Blossom.</p>

<p>"Bennie? Who is Bennie?"</p>

<p>My brother, sir. They are going to shoot him for
sleeping at his post.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes;" and Mr. Lincoln ran his eye over the papers
before him. "I remember. It was a fatal sleep. You
see, child, it was a time of special danger. Thousands of
lives might have been lost for his culpable negligence."</p>

<p>"So my father said," replied Blossom, gravely; "but
poor Bennie was so tired and Jemmie so weak. He did
the work of two, sir, and it was Jemmie's night, not his;
but Jemmie was too tired, and Bennie never thought about
himself, that he was tired, too."</p>

<p>"What is this you say, child? Come here; I do not
understand," and the kind man caught eagerly, as ever,
at what seemed to be a justification of an offense.</p>

<p>Blossom went to him; he put his hand tenderly on her
shoulder and turned up the pale, anxious face toward his.
How tall he seemed! and he was the President of the
United States, too. But Blossom told her simple and
straightforward story, and handed Mr. Lincoln Bennie's
letter to read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">« 150 »</a></span></p>

<p>He read it carefully; then, taking up his pen, wrote a
few hasty lines and rang his bell.</p>

<p>Blossom heard this order given: "Send this dispatch
at once."</p>

<p>The President then turned to the girl and said: "Go
home, my child, and tell that father of yours, who could
approve his country's sentence even when it took the life
of a child like that, that Abraham Lincoln thinks the life
far too precious to be lost. Go back&mdash;or wait until tomorrow.
Bennie will need a change after he has so
bravely faced death; he shall go with you."</p>

<p>"God bless you, sir," said Blossom; and who shall doubt
that God heard and registered the request?</p>

<p>Two days after this interview the young soldier came
to the White House with his little sister. He was called
into the President's private office and a strap fastened
upon his shoulder. Mr. Lincoln then said: "The soldier
that could carry a sick comrade's baggage and die for the
act so uncomplainingly deserves well of his country."
Then Bennie and Blossom took their way to their green
mountain home. A crowd gathered at the Mill depot to
welcome them back; and as Farmer Owen's hand
grasped that of his boy, tears flowed down his cheeks,
and he was heard to say fervently: "The Lord be
praised!"</p>


<p class="caption3">LINCOLN'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is what Abraham Lincoln himself had to say of his own and
his family history, in a letter to his friend, the Hon. Jesse W.
Fell, of Bloomington, Ill., under date of December 20, 1859&mdash;the
year preceding his election to the Presidency, and about the time
his friends were beginning to think seriously of his nomination:</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">"I</span>WAS born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County,
Kentucky. My parents were both born in Virginia,
of distinguished families&mdash;second families,
perhaps I should say. My mother, who died in my tenth
year, was of a family of the name of Hanks, some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">« 151 »</a></span>
whom now reside in Adams and others in Macon County,
Illinois. My paternal grandfather, Abraham Lincoln,
emigrated from Rockingham County, Virginia, to Kentucky,
about 1781 or 1782, where, a year or two later,
he was killed by Indians, not in battle, but by stealth,
when he was laboring to open a farm in the forest. His
ancestors, who were Quakers, went to Virginia from
Berks County, Pennsylvania. An effort to identify them
with the New England family of the same name ended
in nothing more than a similarity of Christian names in
both families, such as Enoch, Levi, Mordecai, Solomon,
Abraham, and the like.</p>

<p>"My father, at the death of his father, was but six
years of age, and he grew up literally without education.
He removed from Kentucky to what is now Spencer
County, Indiana, in my eighth year. We reached our
new home about the time the State came into the Union
(1816). It was a wild region, with many bears and other
wild animals still in the woods. There I grew up. There
were some schools, so-called, but no qualification was
ever required of a teacher beyond 'reading, 'ritin', and
'cipherin' to the Rule of Three. If a straggler, supposed
to understand Latin, happened to sojourn in the neighborhood
he was looked upon as a wizard. There was absolutely
nothing to excite ambition for education. Of
course, when I came of age, I did not know much. Still,
somehow, I could read, write, and cipher to the Rule of
Three, but that was all. I have not been to school since.
The little advance I now have upon this store of education
I have picked up from time to time under the pressure of
necessity.</p>

<p>"I was raised to farm-work, which I continued until I
was twenty-two. At twenty-one I came to Illinois and
passed the first year in Macon County. Then I got to
New Salem, at that time in Sangamon, now in Menard
County, where I remained a year as a sort of clerk in a
store. Then came the Black Hawk War and I was elected
a captain of volunteers&mdash;a success which gave me more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">« 152 »</a></span>
pleasure than any I have had since. I went through the
campaign, was elected, ran for the Legislature in the same
year (1832), and was beaten&mdash;the only time I have ever
been beaten by the people. The next, and three succeeding
biennial elections, I was elected to the Legislature.
I was not a candidate afterwards. During this legislative
period I had studied law and removed to Springfield
to practice it. In 1846 I was once elected to the lower
House of Congress, but was not a candidate for reëlection.
From 1849 to 1854, both inclusive, practiced law
more assiduously than ever before. Always a Whig in
politics, and generally on the Whig electoral ticket making
active canvasses. I was losing interest in politics
when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise aroused me
again. What I have done since then is pretty well
known.</p>

<p>"If any personal description of me is thought desirable
it may be said I am, in height, six feet four inches, nearly;
lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and
eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair,
and gray eyes. No other marks or brands recollected.</p>

<p class="caption3">HOW THEY SANG THE "STAR SPANGLED
BANNER" WHEN LINCOLN WAS
INAUGURATED</p>

<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Thomas Nast</span></p>

<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">I</span>WAS in Washington a few days prior to the inauguration
of Lincoln in 1861, having been sent by the
Harpers to take sketches when that event should come
off. I did nothing but walk around the city and feel the
public pulse, so to speak. There was no necessity of saying
anything to anybody. You intuitively recognized that
trouble was brewing. Many people had sworn that Lincoln
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">« 153 »</a></span>
should not be inaugurated. Their utterances had
fired the Northern heart, and the people loyal to the old
flag were just as determined that the lawfully elected
President should be inaugurated, though blood should
flow in the attempt.</p>

<p>It was an awful time. People looked different then
than they do now. Little knots of men could be seen
conversing together in whispers on street corners, and
even the whispers ceased when a person unknown to them
approached. Everybody seemed to suspect everyone else.
Women looked askance at each other, and children
obliged to be out would scurry home as if frightened,
probably having been given warning by the parents.</p>

<p>The streets at night, for several nights prior to the
inaugural ceremonies, were practically deserted. There
was a hush over everything. It seemed to me that the
shadow of death was hovering near. I had constantly
floating before my eyes sable plumes and trappings of
woe. I could hear dirges constantly and thought for a
while that I would have to leave the place or go crazy.</p>

<p>I knew that all these somber thoughts were but imagination,
but I also knew that the something which had influenced
my imagination was tangible&mdash;really existed.</p>

<p>The 4th of March came and Mr. Lincoln was inaugurated
quietly and without ostentation. After the services
were over and it became known that Mr. Lincoln had
really been inducted into office there was a savage snarl
went up from the disaffected ones.</p>

<p>The snarl was infectious.</p>

<p>It was answered by just as savage growls all over the
city. But nothing was said. A single yell of defiance, a
pistol-shot, or even an oath would have precipitated a
conflict.</p>

<p>Men simply glared at each other and gnashed their
teeth, but were careful not to grit them so it could be
heard. I went to my room in the Willard and sat down
to do some work. I couldn't work. The stillness was
oppressive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">« 154 »</a></span></p>

<p>At least a dozen times I picked up my pencils, only to
throw them down again. I got up and paced the floor
nervously. I heard men on either side of me doing the
same thing. Walking didn't relieve the severe mental
strain. I sat down in my chair and pressed my head in
my hands.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard a window go up and someone step
out on the balcony of the Ebbit House, directly opposite.
Everybody in the hotel had heard him.</p>

<p>What is he going to do? I asked myself, and I suppose
everyone else propounded the same mental interrogation.</p>

<p>We hadn't to wait long.</p>

<p>He began to sing the Star-Spangled Banner in a clear,
strong voice.</p>

<p>The effect was magical, electrical. One window went
up, and another, and heads popped out all over the neighborhood.
People began to stir on the streets. A crowd
soon gathered. The grand old song was taken up and
sung by thousands.</p>

<p>The spell was broken, and when the song was finished
tongues were loosened, and cheer after cheer rent the air.</p>

<p>The man rooming next to me rapped on my door and
insisted that I should take a walk with him. As we
passed along the corridors we were joined by others, men
wild with joy, some of them weeping and throwing their
arms around each other's neck.</p>

<p>Others were singing and all were happy.</p>

<p>Washington was itself again. The "Star-Spangled
Banner" had saved it.</p>


<p class="caption3">LINCOLN'S FAVORITE POEM</p>

<p class="caption3">MORTALITY</p>

<p class="caption4">(O WHY SHOULD THE SPIRIT OF MORTAL BE PROUD?)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> evening of March 22, 1864," says F. B. Carpenter, "was a
most interesting one to me. I was with the President alone in his
office for several hours. Busy with pen and papers when I went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">« 155 »</a></span>
in, he presently threw them aside and commenced talking to me
of Shakespeare, of whom he was very fond. Little Tad, his son,
coming in, he sent to the library for a copy of the plays, and
then read to me several of his favorite passages. Relapsing into
a sadder strain, he laid the book aside, and leaning back in his
chair said:</p>

<p>"'There is a poem which has been a great favorite with me
for years, which was first shown to me when a young man by a
friend, and which I afterward saw and cut from a newspaper
and learned by heart. I would,' he continued, 'give a great deal
to know who wrote it,<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> but I have never been able to ascertain.'
Then, half-closing his eyes, he repeated the verses to me as
follows:"</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span class="dropcap">O</span>WHY should the spirit of mortal be proud?<br />
Like a fast-flitting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,<br />
A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,<br />
He passes from life to his rest in the grave.<br />
<br />
The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,<br />
Be scattered around, and together be laid;<br />
And the young and the old, and the low and the high,<br />
Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie.<br />
<br />
The child that a mother attended and loved,<br />
The mother that infant's affection that proved,<br />
The husband that mother and infant that blessed,<br />
Each, all, are away to their dwelling of rest.<br />
<br />
The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye,<br />
Shone beauty and pleasure,&mdash;her triumphs are by;<br />
And the memory of those that beloved her and praised<br />
Are alike from the minds of the living erased.<br />
<br />
The hand of the king that the scepter hath borne,<br />
The brow of the priest that the miter hath worn,<br />
The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">« 156 »</a></span>
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.<br />
<br />
The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap,<br />
The herdsman who climbed with his goats to the steep,<br />
The beggar that wandered in search of his bread,<br />
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.<br />
<br />
The saint that enjoyed the communion of heaven,<br />
The sinner that dared to remain unforgiven,<br />
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,<br />
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.<br />
<br />
So the multitude goes, like the flower and the weed<br />
That wither away to let others succeed;<br />
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,<br />
To repeat every tale that has often been told.<br />
<br />
For we are the same that our fathers have been;<br />
We see the same sights that our fathers have seen,&mdash;<br />
We drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun,<br />
And we run the same course that our fathers have run.<br />
<br />
The thoughts we are thinking, our fathers would think;<br />
From the death we are shrinking from, they too would shrink;<br />
To the life we are clinging to, they too would cling;<br />
But it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing.<br />
<br />
They loved, but their story we cannot unfold;<br />
They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold;<br />
They grieved, but no wail from their slumbers will come;<br />
They enjoyed, but the voice of their gladness is dumb.<br />
<br />
They died, ay! they died! and we things that are now,<br />
That walk on the turf that lies over their brow,<br />
Who make in their dwellings a transient abode,<br />
Meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road.<br />
<br />
Yea! hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">« 157 »</a></span>
Are mingled together in sunshine and rain;<br />
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the dirge,<br />
Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.<br />
<br />
'Tis the wink of an eye, 'tis the draught of a breath,<br />
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,<br />
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud,&mdash;<br />
O why should the spirit of mortal be proud?<br />

<p class="caption3">THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> address of Abraham Lincoln's was delivered at the dedication
of the National Cemetery, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania,
November 19, 1863. The great battles fought at Gettysburg, in
July, 1863, made that spot historic ground. It was early perceived
that the battles were critical, and they are now looked
upon as the turning-point of the war of the Union. The ground
where the fiercest conflict raged was taken for a national cemetery,
and the dedication of the place was made an occasion of
great solemnity. The orator of the day was Edward Everett,
who was regarded as the most finished public speaker in the
country. Mr. Everett made a long and eloquent address, and
was followed by the President in a short and simple speech
which deeply affected its hearers, and later the country, as a great
speech. The impression created on the audience has deepened
with time. Mr. Stanton's (Secretary of War in Lincoln's Cabinet)
prophecy as to the lasting qualities of the President's
address has materialized. He said: "Edward Everett has made
a speech that will make many columns in the newspapers, and
Mr. Lincoln's perhaps forty or fifty lines. Everett's is the
speech of a scholar, polished to the last possibility. It is elegant
and it is learned; but Lincoln's speech will be read by a
thousand men where one reads Everett's, and will be remembered
as long as anybody's speeches are remembered who
speaks the English language."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">F</span>OURSCORE and seven years ago, our fathers
brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived
in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a
great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation
so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We
are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">« 158 »</a></span>
come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place
for those who here gave their lives that that nation
might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we
should do this. But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate,
we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here,
have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or
detract. The world will little note, nor long remember,
what we say here, but it can never forget what they did
here. It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here
to the unfinished work which they who fought here have
thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here
dedicated to the great task remaining before us,&mdash;that
from these honored dead we take increased devotion to
that cause for which they gave the last full measure of
devotion,&mdash;that we here highly resolve that these dead
shall not have died in vain,&mdash;that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom,&mdash;and that government
of the people, by the people, for the people, shall
not perish from the earth.</p>
